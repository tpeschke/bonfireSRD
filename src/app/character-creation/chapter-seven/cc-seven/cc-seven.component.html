        <p>A character can also retrain Skills by refunding the CrP they've already spent. This takes 1 day / 10 CrP
          getting refunded,
          however, it does come with a few restrictions: first is that you can't retrain free purchases you get and the
          second is that these
          refunding and then reinvesting that CrP doesn't change your spent CrP for your leveling threshold.

          <p>If you're looking for a particular ability, give your GM the heads-up before starting and discuss what you
            might do to get it. This will
            make life much easier for both of you.

        <p>Non-standard abilities can also be used as a reward in lieu of Wondrous Items. So, if you would give out a
          Relic
          or Occult Item, give out an ability instead, either through a divine boon or because of some talent a
          character
          has discovered they have.</p>

        <p>You can also give out leveling abilities but, once gained, the character will need to continue to sacrifice
          and
          train to increase them: they don’t level up automatically as they don’t come naturally to them, although this
          can be for a lesser cost.</p>
      </div>

        <p>If you don’t want to keep track of that (and I don’t blame you), you can have these abilities increase at
          half
          the rate as they normally would but still increase automatically at level up.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'MaybeyoucanEAqELNvbgn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Maybe you can’t find a Class ability that matches what your player is going for. A common example that
          I’m
          sure will come up for you is ambidexterity.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'InthiscaseuHBYAqiISn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>In this case, use the same rules but give them that ability.</p>

        <p>So if a character is constantly using his off-hand in combat, giving him a heavy penalty, after 2d4!+2
          combats,
          he’s gotten the hang of it and gains ambidexterity.</p>

        <p>Beyond abilities, you can also use this to reward players by either discounting Skills or just
          giving them to them. So, a character who uses a weapon in a Combat Skill Suite they're not Trained in, can get
          that Skill Suite at a discount or for free at the next level up (or even during play).</p>

        <p>While a character may use the Recruiting skill to find hirelings at any time, after a character reaches
          level
          5,
          they start having people seek them out. At that point, and at every level (or 2 for those with a Weird-Adept
          Class) above that, the GM rolls on the Follower Attracted table found below but to give context to
          it,
          let's talk about the different types you can attract.</p>

        <p>These are those that wish to swim in the wake of the big fish, primarily profiting off the other followers of
          the
          party and are often washerwoman, prostitutes, or errand boys. They don’t ask anything of the party but are
          happy
          to be hired for specialty jobs as long as they pay well.</p>

        <p>Hirelings make up the paid help. They often seek out the party directly and have a basic skill or two they
          can
          offer. The idea is that the party will help them further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll
          make themselves as helpful as possible - such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.

        <p>Hirelings won’t break contracts unless the captain of the party falls into Little Integrity and will be more
          loyal
          than
          groupies, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in their contract to do so.</p>

        <p>These are those that could be full adventurers on their own but has hitched their wagon to your train in
          hopes of
          getting more. They’re there out of loyalty but they do demand a greater share of the loot due to the fact that

        <p>Sidekicks are something special. A Sidekick is a person who is completely loyal to a character. They would
          lay
          down their lives for a character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call upon over the

        <p>Any new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is
          recognized as
          an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower can be

        <p>Even before level 5, a character can search out his Sidekick, however, they must be old friends from
