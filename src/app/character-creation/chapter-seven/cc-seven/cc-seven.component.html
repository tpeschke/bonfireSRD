        <p>Check your selected Archetypes to see if they have any of their Abilities that either grow stronger (i.e.,
          the
          Thug’s Precision Strike), gain additional free Skills (i.e., any of the Expert Archetype’s Skill Focuses), or
          gain something else for free (e.g., the Weird-Adept Archetypes gaining new Rudiments - rules to which can be found in Acquiring Rudiments sidebar under the Weird-Adept Generalist Archetype of <a [routerLink]='["/character-creation/3"]'>Chapter 2.3 Archetypes</a>).</p>

        <p>After that, if you’ve spent CrP to specialize into a new Archetype, you do so now, following the normal rules

        <p>Another option that Weird-Adepts have is to learn spells from each other but spells are complex things with more layers than an onion, so it’s not a simple task to teach another a
          Rudiment you know, even if they’re using the same magic system.</p>

        <p>The first step is to be taught the basic of the Rudiment. This is an Weirdcraft Skill Check with the penalty
          being
          set by which type of magic is doing the teaching and learning.</p>

        <p>For instance, a Sourcerer’s understanding of magic is innate, making it hard to articulate how they’re able
          to do
          something to someone who understands that same thing through study. In the same way, Wizards and Mages shape
          magic completely differently than Speakers who shape spells using the Divine Language.</p>

        <p>This takes a 1d4! days of study and teaching, as well as ‘dry’ runs, after which the Check is made.</p>

        <p>If it’s successful, the person has the basics and may gain that Rudiment as part of their normal level up
          (instead
          of rolling a random spell) or they may learn is instantly, but this takes additional work, costing them CrP to
          the tune of 25 - the learner’s Int score, as they have to devote additional time to finally cementing it in
          memory, time that might be taking up with other things.</p>
