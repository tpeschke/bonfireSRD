        <p>You don’t really need to know the difference because they work the same when you’re actually running the
          game,
          but Skills represent silos areas of knowledge (being good at Athletics doesn’t make you good at Tactics) while
          Training represents knowledge that is interrelated (you can’t reasonable learn how to strike more accurately

        <p>So, why would you take training in multiple weapons once you have one melee and one ranged? Because this
          training
          allows you to further master that weapon, increasing its usefulness.</p>

        <p>Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Trainings are further training in those particular fields, like the name
          implies. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training in.</p>

        <p>Each of these types of Training has two things: Tiers, which represent how broad your knowledge is (sort of
          like
          Suite Suites and Advanced Skills), and Ranks.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancezMYKUUPOYN'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, the Tiers of Armor training are All Armor, Armor Type, and Specific Armor. So, if you could
          gain a
          bonus for using all armors, or medium armors, or a single type of armor, like brigandine. Obviously, the
          broader
          the area of knowledge the more applications but the most expensive it’s going to be to increase your bonus
          with
          them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'EverytypewilUsRezelGcW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Every type will also have areas you can specialize in. These are the same across the Tiers of that type of
          Advanced Training, but you train in specific Tiers. So, Armor Advanced Training has Defense, Recovery
          Modifier,
          Fatigue, and Initiative as its areas. Each purchase in that area gives them a Rank in one of the Tiers, which
          is
          a bonus that’s applied when applicable. This bonus can't bring a negative bonus above 0, however.</p>

        <p>For example, let’s say that you want to increase your training in Scale Armor, which, as we all know, has the
          stats of Def 0, Init 3, Recovery 1, and Fatigue of Bloodied. If you want to get a Rank 5 in Fatigue, you would

        <p>Ideally, that means that you bought Rank 4 in Init, Rank 3 in Recovery, and Rank 2 in Def. Notice that that

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ItoftenpaysWJYblaKWJW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute subjects with incredible
          depth
          and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='SkillSpecialimNswHyGqRo' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SkillSpecialimNswHyGqRo'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced Skill that your character spends
          extra
          time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='SkillspecialiwYXmQPvquB' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SkillspecialiwYXmQPvquB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each layer gives a +1 to your
          effective Rank when it comes into play.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='ForexampleaIPVOQtZcWq' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForexampleaIPVOQtZcWq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For example, a monster hunter studying predators, would gain a+1 Rank, while another that studies flying
          predators would gain a +2 Rank bonus to their checks, and a monster hunter that studies the flying predators
          of
          the Uchka Mountains would gain a bonus of +3 to their Rank.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='TheremaycomeAVKIgJVMZW' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheremaycomeAVKIgJVMZW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it may be kind of helpful, as
          the
          max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='SowhenencoubfHYywrhSL' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SowhenencoubfHYywrhSL'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, when encountering a land predator in the Uchka Mountains, all three monster hunters would only gain +1 to
          their Rank.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='ThatsortofsPkEocOPAHU' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThatsortofsPkEocOPAHU'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort, and man only has so much time and energy to
          give. The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a character can have is equal to half his
          Intelligence score.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='AcharactercaZNDmOZXEBO' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AcharactercaZNDmOZXEBO'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go out of the way to learn
          more
          about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the number of layers in the
          specialization plus one.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='AcharactercaljwCPgDwYf' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AcharactercaljwCPgDwYf'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill Specialization after his initial
          purchase
          of it, but it costs additional amount of CrPs equal to twice the base cost of the Advanced Skill.</p>

          character does Willh to branch out, his mastery of Law for that new culture starts at 0, as he must learn
          everything from the ground up. Diving more into his own culture’s laws (buying this Advanced Skill for his
          culture) uses the Lore Skill as base, as per usual.</p>

        <p>This Skill allows a character to read and write in a language’s alphabet, giving them the power to pen books
          and
          poems, or passive aggressive notes. A character who's taken the Lore Skill Suite is considered to be literate
          in

        <p>This Skill can be taken multiple times, each instance representing mastery of a new writing system. The
          scribe
          can then use that alphabet to pen any language they know, in the same way that we could use the Latin Alphabet
          to pen Arabic or the Korean Alphabet to write English.</p>

        <p>To decipher a text, the person needs to know both the alphabet it's written in and the language it's using,

        <p>With proper treatment and nursing, a wound that would lay you out for weeks, may only keep you down for a

        <p>So, a success against a 5 Severity Wound means that it was treated properly and takes 10 days to completely
          heal
          ( 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 ) instead of the normal 15.</p>

        <p>You may also increase the Difficulty modifier by half again as much - if you succeed, you take 2 days off per
          Severity. So, if you're against a d20!+9, you can make it a d20!+14 ( 9 + ( 9 / 2 ) ) for that bonus.</p>

          goes
          beyond simply hearing something: listening allows the character to know when an otherWille innocuous noise is
          actually something to pay attention to though it might not always be apparent why at first.</p>

        <p>By studying the best tactics and how to fight in certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his
          surroundings and combat styles emerge. Combat Styles can be anything but involved in parts: a situation and a
          metric.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThissituationdDwZsdKFvH'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This situation is when the Combat Style is most effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting
          on
          rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc. Really anything (as long as
          your
          GM approves).</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThesecondparnfrXyNRkob'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The second part of the Combat Style is the metric applied to. This can be anything you could normally
          specialize
          in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'IfthesituatiWDmLlwAbVj'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>If the situation is applicable, the character receives a +1 to that metric for every 2 Ranks of that Skill
          he’s
          obtained.</p>

        <p>So, a character with the Combat Skill (unarmed fighting, attack) at 5 who gets into a tavern brawl gets a +2
          to
          attack as long as he doesn’t draw his weapon and simply uses fisticuffs.</p>

        <p>Having a high Rank in Tactics doesn't automatically give you Combat Style bonuses under all circumstances and

        <p>It’s Wille to know what something is worth before selling and buying it. This Skill handles that and is taken

        <p>If a character has the appropriate Skill covering the item he’s looking to sell/purchase, a Check will tell
          them
          what kind of deal they're getting on the item - how much they’re being ripped off or how much of a steal it

        <p>You may think that the truth is powerful enough to carry your argument, but you can be beat out by a master
          of
          deception. Articulation is the Skill of rhetoric and formulating the truth in such a way that makes it the

          convincing.</p>

        <p>The level of Difficulty to convince someone is how much evidence you can supply to back up your arguments.
          This
          is opposed by Deception or Articulation but only if someone is actively trying to deceive or convince the same
          person as you.</p>

        <p>Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s mind. Others may lie more effectively
          than
          you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them.</p>

        <p>With this Skill Suite, someone can identify a spell, point out needed regents and processes for ritual
          shapings,
          detect if something is touched by the Weird and what its properties are, or even detect if a spell has been

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThefirstbonujVlOALXuuq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The first bonus that having an Advanced Weirdcraft Skill gives you is that it gives you further insight into
          a
          particular Weird Tradition, allowing you to detect it better. For more information on what each Tradition
          specializes in, head over to <a [routerLink]='["/rules-reference/6"]'>Chapter 1.6: The Weird</a>.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheotherthinlJvNEysbrj'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The other thing it does is allow you to shape cantrip versions of spells from that Tradition, regardless of
          Archetype. The ability to shape is inherit in all living things though it takes decades of practice, a strong
          family bloodline, and/or a natural gift to do what Weird-Adept Archetypes do, a form of practical "folkweird"
          is
          often passed down as part of the tools of the trade.</p>

        <p>This doesn't, and will never, allow someone to shape the full version of a spell but it can give them a boost
          or
          an edge. The specific details should be left up to the GM and player, but they should always be appropriate to
          the Tradition and never be more powerful than a spell that does the same thing. Most commonly this will mean
          it
          will get used as a Helper Skill.</p>

        <p>Shaping a cantrip is still shaping and is stressful and so that anytime any of these Skills are used to
          shape,
          the shaper gets 2d4! Stress.</p>
