          skills.</p>

        <p><strong>Baby-sitting</strong> While an individual Cateran may

        <p> Whenever a person engaged with the Cateran tries to disengage, the Cateran gets an
          immediate free attack that,
          if it hits, deals half damage. This happens regardless of where they are on the

        <p><strong>Closed Openings</strong> Flanking is the art of
          dividing people’s attention and the
          Cateran has perfected that art. Anyone flanked by a Cateran lowers their attack
          die by 1 size, regardless of who

        <p><strong class="optional">*</strong><strong>Mutieren</strong> A Cateran knows to move their blade to get into
          places their opponents wouldn't expect. If facing an enemy whose weapon has a base Parry or who is carrying a
          shield, the Cateran receives a bonus to Attack equal to halve their level, rounded up. This ability isn't

          can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 7 Stress, a Cateran can negate any bonuses an opponent gets
          from moving, whether that’s shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops their opponent from moving.

        <p><strong>Bum Rush</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to
          more effectively flank their
          opponents. When flanking from the side, you and your allies lower your target’s
          defense die by 1,
          including
          the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This
          doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p>

          get his hit off first, perhaps crippling his enemy before they have change to respond. Doing so would leave

          <p>The Higher Planes are those that exist above the crude and primitive world and so, naturally, the Divines
            are

          <p>A Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is associated with, and it usually gives an
            insight
            to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the Divine
            of
            that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the same way
            that
            while Venus was associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by the Romans.
            Still, your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.</p>

            and death, creation and destruction. They may be weak now, but they will wax unstoppable. When you invoke a

        <p> Every 24 hours, the Runegalder can seal 3 spells. He can also bind an additional

          at any time by simply speaking the rune they’re linked to, once prepared, which only takes 
          1 Second, however, the Weirding is weaker when Shaped this way: for every Boon a person

        <p><strong>Grimoire</strong> This is the Runegalder’s spell book and keeps the spells that he binds to runes.
          Unlike a normal spell book, however, the spells are scribed in meteorite ink and blood that seals their magic
          power in the text itself. This means that the Runegalder’s Grimoire does the channeling latently for him.</p>

          These spells can’t have a Drain greater than 7 + their total level (so at 1st level, his spells can only have
          a
          Drain of 8) when it is scribed into the Grimoire. A spell’s Rudiments cannot be redistributed and changed:

        <p class="italic"> So, a 2nd level Runegalder scribes a new spell. He can max out at 7 Drain. He chooses to make
          it a Wall Shape, Near Origin (4 Drain) and for its Effect, he chooses
          Disorient (2 Drain), for a total of 7. He could have also made it Chain Shape instead for 1 Drain, and Stacked

        <p>Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless their Effect is stacked, in which

        <p> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must be sealed to different
          runes. So, if the Runegalder has a 8 SP Flash Grenade and a 11 SP Flash Grenade, he would need two runes to
