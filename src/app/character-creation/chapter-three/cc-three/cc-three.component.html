        <p>For instance, Fighter Archetypes tend to be good at things related to combat. So, if you’re looking to make a
          combat focused character, you can look there. They are Expert, Weird-Adept, Servant, Socialite, and Fighter.
          You

        <p>Any SP remaining after the initial Shaping of a spell becomes fixed within it; these may only be used to

          can only be used to Shape a new spell, not added to an existing one.

        <p><strong>Closed Openings</strong> Flanking is the art of

          Parry or who is carrying a shield,
          the Cateran receives a +1 to Attack +1 for every 2 levels they've obtained. This

        <p><strong class="optional">*</strong><strong>Shadowing</strong> By keeping close to their opponent,
          the Cateran can negate people’s defensive posturing. By taking 7 Stress, a

          shifting, stepping back, or whatever and also stops their opponent from moving.

        <p> The Cateran can do this as many times as they want but the Stress cost doubles each
          time they do so, though this resets once they’ve had time to destress. Also,
          this Stress cost is lowered by 1 for every 3 levels they’ve obtained, down to 3

        <p><strong>Bum Rush</strong> A Cateran can also use his allies to
          more effectively flank their
          opponents. When flanking from the side, you and your allies lower your target’s
          defense die by 1,
          including
          the dice of those using shields (though they still get a chance to Parry). This
          doesn’t, however, give you any benefit for attacking from directly behind.</p>

          near to dodge the grim reaper and keep running. After the results are given,
          the Rascal can take 2 Stress to modify his results by 1. These may be done with

        <p>Note that spells cast by the Runegalder only last their Interval unless their Effect
          is stacked, in which case, it either increases that Interval by a like amount or
          gains the Stacking bonus but not both. This is decided when the spell is cast.

        <p> Spells inscribed at different levels count as completely different spells and must
          be sealed to different runes. So, if the Runegalder has a 8 SP Flash Grenade and
          a 11 SP Flash Grenade, he would need two runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply
          bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then choose which he wanted to use in the
          moment.</p>
