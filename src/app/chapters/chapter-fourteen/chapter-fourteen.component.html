          your character

          Or let's say that there wasn't enough time to do anything on your Goal, but you managed to help two other
          players; you'd
          still get 35 Ex at the end of the session (25 for the first, 10 for the second).
          Or, or, if you were a real wunderkind, and moved towards your Goal AND helped the two other players, you'd get
          45 Ex (25 + 10 + 10).

        <p> A character can switch around their Traits, switching a Strong one for a Medium one, or a Medium one for a
          Weak one. This swaps the number of dice - not the size of those dice. So, swapping a 1d8 trait for 3d10 trait
          makes one 3d8 and the other 1d10.</p>

        <p> At every odd level, they gain a free roll that’s added to their total Vitality. This is not affected by
