        <p> You don’t have to use these rules all the time, i.e., you don’t have to roll to see if your character
          successfully walks across a room, but at times they’re a good way to semi-randomly determine the outcome of a
          tricky task, i.e., walking across a room full of traps. </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pxpShhevAfR'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> There are two types of skills that you’re going to be pulling from: Skill Suites and Advanced Skills.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pYVKsklDTte'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> Skill Suites represent broad swathes of knowledge that cover a variety of subjects. Suites are hard to
          increase
          because there’s so much ground to cover but can be used if you don’t have the specific Advanced Skill. An
          example of this is the Survival and Lore Skill Suites.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8pVBOORfIHzO' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pVBOORfIHzO'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> Advanced Skills are more tightly focused, covering one intellectual discipline. They’re easier to master but
          may
          not be applicable in every case. An example of this would be the First Aid, Fire Building, and Foraging skills
          in the Survival Skill Suite and the Arcana, History, and Medicine skills in the Lore Skill Suite.</p>

        <p> Throughout your character’s career, she’ll acquire and improve her skills. Both types of skills are
          purchased
          with CrP, that is spent either at Character Creation or on leveling up. All skills have a unique cost that
          represents how easy or difficult they are to master. You pay the price, you improve the skill.</p>

        <h1>CALCULATING RANK</h1>

      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pvrTVawRrAZ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> For Skill Suites, your starting Rank is the 10s digit of the relevant score, the 10s digit of the average of
          the listed scores.
          For Advanced Skill, unless it says otherwise (I'm looking at you Literacy and Combat Style), it is the Rank of
          the mother Skill Suite.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8pcCUJeCdJSB' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pcCUJeCdJSB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, if you have 15 Wis and 18 Cha, your starting Rank in Streetwise is 1. If you didn't purchase Perception,
          your Rank in that is 1 as well since
          it's mother Skill Suite is Streetwise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8pqVqRTkCqsG' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pqVqRTkCqsG'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> It is possible to have a Rank 0.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8ptmNxKgqedZ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> When you purchase a Skill, the cost is Bbase Price - the average of the relevant scores, minimum 1 + the
          previous Rank of that Skill.
          Every purchase increases your Rank in that Skill by 1. Should you purchase a Skill Suite, it also increases
          all of its Advanced Skills by 1
          as well.
        </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8prvieeTWUNt'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> So, let's go back to the above example and say that you purchased Perception twice. You'd have to pay 4
          CrP. The first time you bought it
          it cost 1 ( 15 - 15, minimum 1 + 1 ). Remember that you're already considered to have Rank 1 in it because you
          have Rank 1 in Streetwise.
          The second time costs 3 ( 15 - 15, minimum 1 + 2 ).

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8iTANmWGHVn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute subjects with incredible
          depth
          and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8uzlQmjXQlK'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced Skill that your character spends
          extra
          time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8MjNerdRRXq' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8MjNerdRRXq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each layer gives a +1 to your
          effective Rank when it comes into play.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8sETmtpGVoW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For example, a monster hunter studying predators, would gain a+1 Rank, while another that studies flying
          predators would gain a +2 Rank bonus to their checks, and a monster hunter that studies the flying predators
          of
          the Uchka Mountains would gain a bonus of +3 to their Rank.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8IaFsgCrBGn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it may be kind of helpful, as
          the
          max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8eDiLHhIbWp'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, when encountering a land predator in the Uchka Mountains, all three monster hunters would only gain +1 to
          their Rank.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8cIplcPvnIB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort and man only has so much time and energy to
          give.
          The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a character can have is equal to half his
          Intelligence score.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8qaoPqBsIyT'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go out of the way to
          learn more about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the number of layers in the
          specialization plus one.</p>

        <p>A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill Specialization after his initial
          purchase

        <p> A skill check is rather easy: roll the difficulty dice set by the GM. If you get under your Skill Rank

        <p> Because not all tasks are the same in terms of how challenging they are (building a house is harder than
          building a simple table), Skills Checks are given variable difficulties that are represented by different
          sized dice. The bigger the dice, the harder the task.</p>

        <p> This difficulty dice is an abstraction, of course, and represents a number of things, and so, therefore, can
          be
          changed based on planning and equipment used, or the amount of time granted to complete it. So, for example, a
          character wishing to pick a lock underwater might be rolling a d12!, but one doing the same task while
          blindfolded might be rolling a d20!. </p>

        <p> It may be possible, because this is a fantasy game, to go beyond a Heroic level task, in that case add an
          additional smaller die to a d20!.</p>

        <p> Following the previous example, if someone was trying to pick a lock underwater while blindfolded and having
          to
          do so under a minute, he might roll a d20! + d4!, hoping that that total is under his Skill Rank.</p>

          refers to a host of Skill Checks. To use a metaphor: a Skill Challenge would be breaking into the castle. The
          Skill Checks would be climbing the walls, hiding in the shadows, sneaking past the guards, listening at doors,

          He pipes up and says that even though he made it to the top, the knot of his rope came undone and it is now on
          the ground far below.
          Or, if the player is using crampons, he may state that during the climb, the iron spikes got stuck in the

        <p> This does stack for every piece of equipment he's using, and he only needs to find drawbacks for the amount
          of +1s he needs. So, expanding
          the above example: if our climber is using both rope and crampons, and fails by 1, he only needs to lose his
          rope or break his crampons. If he
          fails by 2, he needs both.

        <p> You can also use this to reduce the Stress you'd get from failing by a like amount. Final note: the
          drawbacks doesn't
          neccessarily have to relate to the check or make it easier directly but it is something that the players just
          can't recover easily.

        <p> Others may offer to help you out with a Skill Check if they’re trained in the specific Advanced Skill
          you’re rolling for, but not for a general Skill Suite check. Doing so follows the same rules as equipment
          with the following clarifications:</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8nUCMPsQwIb'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> The first is that one person will take the lead and actually do the rolling. Everyone else will only be
          worth a +1
          regardless of their Rank in that Skill.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8SPExeFKndX'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> The second is that once a person states a drawback, they're committed to that drawback, whether or not the
          check
          ultimately fails.

        <p> So, for example, a party of three, Kiara, Damien, Amelia, Ryan, and John, are searching a room using
          Perception.
          Their Ranks go Kiara 1, Damien 3, Amelia 4, Ryan none, and John 1. They decide that Amelia is going to be
          doing the
          searching so she's going to roll a d10!. She rolls a 7; 3 off from what she needed. She can still make it,
          because she
          has help but everyone needs to think of a drawback, except Ryan who can't help at all.

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8qUzLfAJAnj'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> Kiara decides that her character is so focused on searching that if she gets jumped, her character will
          increase
          her initiative die: that's a +1. Damien decides that his character, while searching, comes gets in a small
          scuffle
          with the owner of the room because he got into something private and so he lowers his Honor by 1 and, should
          they get
          into a Conflict with the owner, the owner gets a d6 against him. That's also another +1 despite Damien having
          Rank 3
          in Perception.

        <p> John, like always, screws the pooch, and can't think of anything and so Ameila still fails her check. Kiara
          and
          Damien are still saddled with their drawbacks so when the zombie bursts out of the closet, Kiara is so focused
          on
          searching, she fails to notice as quickly as she might have.

        <p> There may be times where a character has enough time to try a Skill Check again, however, he must change
          the
          circumstances in a unique way before he proceeds.</p>

        <p> For example, a character climbing a wall fails his first attempt. He’s got rope and crampons on his shoes
          that
          made the attempt a little easier but he just didn’t make it. He can’t simply roll his check again.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pJatyPBxGly'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> He studies the wall for a bit and his player decides that his character might be better off finding
          footholds if
          he removes his shoes, so he does so. He is now qualified to try again. His GM decides that the difficulty
          remains the same.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pACXGmPwqaZ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> The climber fails again. He can’t simply put his shoes back on: he’s already tried that, so he knots his
          rope to
          make it easier to grip. Now he’s eligible for another try, but since he’s knotted the rope, the GM decides
          that
          it’s a bit easier so this Check is attempted as if it was one difficulty lower. This time, he succeeds.

        <p> A character gains 1 Stress per retry, regardless of the outcome, meaning that are intrepid scaler comes out

          <p> It’s important to think about Skills in Bonfire having three parts: Mechanics, Knowledge, and
            Creativity.

          <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>Mechanics</strong> are the ‘solid’ part of the Skill and give that Skill a
            purpose that can always be utilized. This gives every Skill a definite thing it can do and reason why
            you’d
            spend your precious CrPs on it.</p>

          <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>Knowledge</strong> is a step beyond the mechanic of the Skill. This is most
            evident in the Advanced Lore Skills but it applies to every Skill. A climber can use her Climbing Skill to
            deduce how hard an ascent is going to be or a person with Use Rope can get a sense for how strong a length
            of rope is.</p>

          <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>Creativity</strong> is the final and perhaps the most important part of a
            Bonfire Skill. This is applying and repurposing the Skill in creative ways that aren’t layouted
            specifically
            by the rules. For example, using your Quarter Mastering Skill to stow illegal items in your pack in such a
            way as to not be detected by the searching guards.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>COMBAT STYLE (style)</strong> By studying the best tactics and how to fight in
          certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his surroundings and combat styles emerge. Combat
          Styles
          can be anything but involve to parts: a situation and a metric. This situation is when the Combat Style is
          most
          effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting on rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a
          duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc.. Really anything (as long as your GM approves). The second part of the
          Combat Style is the metric is applied to. This can be anything you could normally specialize in. Both the
          situation and metric are selected at the time of purchase
          and cannot be changed.</p>

          this list is pared down to those areas of knowledge where the common man and the adventurer overlap in their
          needs.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPRAISAL (specific)</strong> It’s wise to know what something is worth before
          selling and buying it. This skill handles that and is taken for a specific type of good, such as books &
          scrolls, livestock, jewelry, armors & armor, and so on.</p>

        <p> If a character has the appropriate skill covering the item he’s looking to sell/purchase, he can get
          within her
          roll, expressed at a percentage, of what the item is currently worth, with the Check based on how common
          the
          item is and how closely it relates to his skill’s focus.</p>

        <p> Additionally, the character should get a bonus if he has any skill that’s applicable to the thing he’s

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>ARTISTRY (specific)</strong> While some many not find the Fine Arts a worthy
          way to
          spend time, others may disagree. Artistry covers all artistic endeavors, including painting, sculpture,
          embroidery and anything else that is done for art’s sake.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>COOKING/BAKING</strong> On the road, a hot meal can count for a lot. A
          character who
          has a hot meal subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes to heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re
          able
          to heal 15 Stress in 120 days, instead of 105.</p>

        <p> On top of this, a character can prep otherwise unpalatable or poisonous food in such a way as to make the
          most
          of it, though it is a Challenging check to do so, meaning they can stretch rations for longer.</p>

        <p> Unless the character is trying to prep a feast worthy of His Imperial Majesty, basic daily cooking only
          requires
          a Trivial check.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>CRAFT (specific)</strong> This skill covers any skill that makes something
          that
          isn’t noted here, such as carpentry, tailoring, basket weaving, pottery, etc.. The GM may adjust the price
          for a
          particularly difficult to master study.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>LEATHERWORKING</strong> From the moment it leaves the beast to the moment the
          final
          touches are finished, leatherworking handles the process of making and crafting works from the hides of
          animals,
          including skinning and tanning. </p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>MAINTAINCE</strong> The skill of tinkers and adventurers, this gives the
          person a
          general knowledge of easy and ad hoc fixes that can be done on the fly. The level of difficulty in repairing
          something is equal to the total penalty it gives, rounded up to the nearest dice size.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pTPidhvfXrw'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> So repairing a spear with a -1 to Attack and Damage is Trivial (d4!), while repairing one with a -3 to
          Attack
          and Damage is Easy (d6!). </p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>METALWORKING</strong> This covers the process of changing crude ore into a
          beautiful
          weapon, armor, or decorative piece. It also covers the construction and repair of more mundane things, like
          plows, but if you’re picking this skill up, I doubt you’re doing it to corner the farmer’s market.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>MUSICIAN (specific)</strong> This covers the mastery of specific instrument,
          including singing. At the end of the day, the dulcet tones of a neatly played mandolin can ease the ache of
          a
          long day. A character who hears someone play an instrument subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes
          to
          heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 10 days, instead of 15.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pKtKsCVyEin'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> This doesn’t stack with others playing, however, and does no good if you’re in a stressful situation, like
          being
          hunted.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERFORMANCE</strong> This skill covers everything from making your case before
          a
          court or a stirring speech before charging into battle. On a success, anyone listening gains a temporary d4
          Devotion to what the performer wants: whether that’s themselves or an organization or a case. If the
          Devotion
          already exists, the size is temporarily increased. Additionally, the Devotion dice size can be increased 1
          for
          every extra level of difficulty the orator passes their check by.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>PERSUASION</strong> You may think that the truth is powerful enough to carry
          your
          argument but you can be beat out by a master of deception. Persuasion is the skill of rhetoric and
          formulating
          the truth in such a way that make it the most convincing.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pVgAmFkendE'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> The level of difficulty to convince someone is how much evidence you can supply to back up your arguments.
          This
          is opposed by Deception or Persuasion but only if someone is trying to actively trying to deceive or
          convince
          the same person as you.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pzaapGuNDZy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s mind. Others may lie more
          effectively
          than you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them.
