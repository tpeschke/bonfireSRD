        <p> Skills are used as a way to determine the success or failure of a given action, based on what your character

        <p> You don’t have to use these rules all the time, i.e., you don’t have to roll to see if your character
          successfully walks across a room, but at times they’re a good way to semi-randomly determine the outcome of a
          tricky task, i.e., walking across a room full of traps. </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pxpShhevAfR'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> There are two types of skills that you’re going to be pulling from: Skill Suites and Advanced Skills.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8pYVKsklDTte' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pYVKsklDTte'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> Skill Suites represent broad swathes of knowledge that cover a variety of subjects. Suites are hard to
          increase
          because there’s so much ground to cover but can be used if you don’t have the specific Advanced Skill. An
          example of this is the Survival and Lore Skill Suites.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8pVBOORfIHzO' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pVBOORfIHzO'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p> Advanced Skills are more tightly focused, covering one intellectual discipline. They’re easier to master but
          may
          not be applicable in every case. An example of this would be the First Aid, Fire Building, and Foraging skills
          in the Survival Skill Suite and the Arcana, History, and Medicine skills in the Lore Skill Suite.</p>

        <p> Throughout your character’s career, she’ll acquire and improve her skills. Both types of skills are
          purchased
          with CrP, that is spent either at Character Creation or on leveling up. All skills have a unique cost that
          represents how easy or difficult they are to master. You pay the price, you improve the skill.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>SKILL SUITES </strong>Your Skill Suites, your starting Rank is the Skill Bonus listed under the corresponding Stat. For Suites with multiple Stats, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='8pcCUJeCdJSB' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pcCUJeCdJSB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>ADVANCED SUITES </strong> Your starting Rank for Advanced Skills is the Rank for the mother Skill Suite.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8pqVqRTkCqsG'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>PURCHASING A SKILL </strong>Skills cost their Base Cost - Skill Bonus + (Current Rank * 2), minimum 1. This is true for both Skill Suites and Advanced Skill. Note that, like Skills Suites above, if there are multiple Stats attached to a Skill, average the Skill Bonus, rounded down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8ptmNxKgqedZ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Every purchase increases your Rank in that Skill by 1. Purchases of Skill Suites also raises the Rank of any child Advanced Skills you’ve already purchased, so that’s nice.</p>

        <h3>SKILL SPECIALIZATIONS</h3>
        <h4 class="advancedHeader">🜂 Advanced Rule</h4>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8iTANmWGHVn' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8iTANmWGHVn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>It often pays to specialize. After all, many dissertations cover extremely minute subjects with incredible
          depth
          and drawing on that well of knowledge can be a huge benefit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='8uzlQmjXQlK' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8uzlQmjXQlK'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill Specializations represent an area of knowledge within an Advanced Skill that your character spends
          extra
          time versing themselves in. As such, they gain a bonus.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8MjNerdRRXq' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8MjNerdRRXq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Skill specializations come in layers, modifiers that narrow down the field. Each layer gives a +1 to your
          effective Rank when it comes into play.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='8sETmtpGVoW' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8sETmtpGVoW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For example, a monster hunter studying predators, would gain a+1 Rank, while another that studies flying
          predators would gain a +2 Rank bonus to their checks, and a monster hunter that studies the flying predators
          of
          the Uchka Mountains would gain a bonus of +3 to their Rank.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8IaFsgCrBGn' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8IaFsgCrBGn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>There may come a time when a specialization only kind of applies. In this case, it may be kind of helpful, as
          the
          max bonus that can be gained from it is +1.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='8eDiLHhIbWp' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8eDiLHhIbWp'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, when encountering a land predator in the Uchka Mountains, all three monster hunters would only gain +1 to
          their Rank.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='8cIplcPvnIB' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8cIplcPvnIB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>That sort of super-focused study takes a lot of time and effort and man only has so much time and energy to
          give.
          The total number of specializations per Advanced Skill that a character can have is equal to half his
          Intelligence score.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='8qaoPqBsIyT' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8qaoPqBsIyT'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A character can gain a specialization like any other skill; having his character go out of the way to
          learn more about his craft. The price is the base cost of the Advanced Skill times the number of layers in the
          specialization plus one.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='8KemRTIrgJd' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'8KemRTIrgJd'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A character can go back and increase the number of layers in his Skill Specialization after his initial
          purchase
          of it, but it costs additional amount of CrPs equal to twice the base cost of the Advanced Skill.</p>

        <p>Before we go off talking about Skill Challenges, time, equipment, and all those other things, it’s first important to understand the very basic mechanic all of those things will hang off of: Skill Checks.</p>

        <p>These are made by rolling the Difficulty Dice (defaulting as a d20!), adding your Rank and comparing it to

        <p>Skill Checks refer to a single roll against a single Skill, while a Skill Challenge refers to a host of Skill Checks. To use a metaphor: a Skill Challenge would be breaking into the castle. The Skill Checks would be climbing the walls, hiding in the shadows, sneaking past the guards, listening at doors, lockpicking any locks, etc.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'beforewebeingweneed'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Before we begin, we need to talk about the scale, or Pace of Skill Checks, just so you understand it.
          Different Skill Challenges take different amounts of time and cover different areas and this contributes to the feel 
          of that specific Challenge. 
        </p>
      </div>

        <div id='forinstanceapersontra' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'forinstanceapersontra'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, a person tracking an outlaw over in the hinterlands has a very different Pace than one who is chasing 
          that outlaw down in a city. In the first case, the Challenge can stretch for month, so the Pace could be days or weeks while 
          in the second case, it's a matter of minutes, so the Pace is in seconds.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='essentiallythehiote' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'essentiallythehiote'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Essentially, the Pace is how much time a Skill Check takes up. You'll notice that all Skills have a Base Time, which is either 1/2 Pace, 1 Pace, 
          or Per Asset. So, if the Pace is 1 day, 1/2 Pace Skills take 6 hours, 1 Pace Skills take 1 day, and per Asset Skills are per Asset, which 
          will be discussed further in the Tools at your Disposal section.

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'GivenaninfinCdtnAMrpmP'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Like a warrior has Vitality, experts have Clocks. These Clocks represent how your character could fail or succeed at their Skill Challenge and are defined by the how of how you tackle the Challenge. These are known as Fail State and Objective Clocks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='SoforinstanrzeOGWiHsD' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoforinstanrzeOGWiHsD'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, let’s say that you’re breaking into the house to steal the royal jewels. You have 2 ways you can fail, running into a patrol or running into the family, and 1 way to succeed, finding those jewels. If you just go in blind, your GM may say that it will take 3 minutes for the guards to find you, 5 minutes to run into a member of the family, and 15 minutes to find the jewels, though your character won’t know this starting out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='IfyouknowyoVVEQbXzNID' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'IfyouknowyoVVEQbXzNID'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You can modify, remove, discover, or get to know Clocks by gathering information. Continuing the above example: by getting to know how the patrols move around the mansion, your character can always be where they’re not so not there’s no chance of running to a patrol and that Clock doesn’t exist any longer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='ThepointistpoykrfcxCf' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThepointistpoykrfcxCf'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Maybe, through some friends who work there, he discovers that the family randomly moves around the house so it’s impossible to know their movements at any given time but he can guess how likely he is to run into them. Now, he knows that there is 5 minutes on the family Clock.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='basetimeyoullnoticeonthe' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'basetimeyoullnoticeonthe'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>And, finally, he uses some reasoning to decide that the jewels are probably in the private quarters of the mansion, vastly narrowing his searching and reducing that Clock from 15 to 7 minutes. Though, if he’s wrong, that Clock also disappears because it won’t matter how long he searches: what he’s looking for isn’t there.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='forthemostpartplayers' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'forthemostpartplayers'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For the most part, players shouldn’t know what Clocks they’re up against or how long they have on them starting out and need to use their brains, Skills, and other party members to discover the information. Knowledge is power.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='sidebarShell marginBottom'>
        <h2 class='sidebarTitle'>Clock of Damocles</h2>
        <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'gmshouldrunthechallge'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p> GMs should run the Challenge off of the most urgent Fail State Clocks, though 
            what this Clock is counting down to should be kept from the players. This keeps 
            the threat of failure forward in their mind, even when that actual threat is out of view.
            Updates should be given based on 0 for that Clock.

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'gmshouldrunthechallge'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p> So, for instance, the players are scouting an enemy base. There are patrols nearby 
            but the players don't know that. The patrol takes 2 hours to make their rounds and the Pace of 
            the Challenge is set to 30 minutes.

        </div>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'thegmstatsthatplayers'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p> The GM states that the players have 2 hours left: what're they going to do with that time?
            That's all they know: something is going to happen in 2 hours and they need to make the best use of that time.

          <p> Should the players figure out what the Clock of Damocles represents it should become the next big unknown 
            threat. It should also change if the players are able to modifiy or remove it.
          </p>

        <p>Note that Fail State Clocks will continue to tick along with in-game time, while Object Clocks will only progress when the players make checks.
          So, if you're on the lam, the Fail State Clock that represents you being found continues to count down to 0, while the Object Clock that represents 
          you escaping will stop if your character decides to sleep through the night.

        <p>Everything in a Skill Challenge is considered in time. You don’t say “the wall is 200 feet high,” instead you say “it’ll take you 3 minutes to scale the wall.” This represents the minimum amount of time to get there and the base line around which you’ll plan your trip.
          This can also help you set the Pace of a Skill Challenge and build the Clocks around that.

        <p>For instance, the objective is to find the enemies base. You start by simply wandering around their territory trying to find it, but part way through, you run into a patrol, when that Clock runs out. You don’t get caught so you think: this patrol will probably head back to base eventually so I should tail them. The objective is the same but suddenly the How is different and so, essentially, a new Skill Challenge is starting with different Clocks to deal with.</p>

        <p>Clocks can have two states: Passive and Active. These represent what the opposition is going to roll. You can also go into Dire Straits on a Clock, which I’ll get to in a bit.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>PASSIVE </strong>means that whomever you’re up against doesn’t realize they’re up against you. This is the, for example, the watchman doing his nightly rounds or the river you have to cross.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ObviouslythePPqiYslpwa'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>By default they roll a d20! + a dice that represents their Rank or Difficulty. For the watchman, it’s based on his Perception Rank and for the river, it’s based on white water it is.</p>

        <p>To figure out what to roll, take the Rank and turn it into the nearest dice size, rounded down. So, if the watchman’s Perception is 7, he’s going to roll a d6!, if a 4, a d4!, or if a 3 or less, he gets nothing.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>ACTIVE </strong>means that whomever you’re up against realizing something is amiss and is now actively working against you. This doesn’t mean your caught: it just means the person is on high alert.</p>

        <p>On top of this, any failed checks subtracts your Base Time from any applicable Clocks again: so when Stealthing, instead of eating up 1 minute of your time, 2 minutes are eaten up instead.</p>

        <p>So, returning to the original example; you’re in the house and know the patrols but, as you’re sneaking around, you stubble and make a noise. This failure doesn’t affect your Objective Clock, nor does it affect the families Clock, but it does alert the guards a room or two over. This means that a new Clock is started since the guards are now on the hunt for something suspicious.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'PassiveopposicXZoAAflwK'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Generally, these new Clock start as Passive and when they run out, as long as they also didn’t go Active, they simply disappear: in this case, the guards go back to their patrols and dismiss the noise.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'NowtotryandXJqNQTPeyG'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, a Passive Clock for patrols means that, on your next failure, the guard runs into you but they’re completely surprised while if they were Active, they would have figured out exactly where you are.</p>

        <p>This can also be used to determine other outcomes.

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'themostbasicrolls'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The most basic roll assumes that everything is on a level playing field, which it rarely is. Different tasks may be harder than others, like trying to stealth in broad daylight, or easier, like trying to spot someone stealthing in broad daylight. These are considered as Factors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'facotrsaddadicetooneside'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Factors add a dice to one side’s roll, with the size of that dice and who it gets added to based on how many advantages or disadvantages that side has. Generally, each Factor adds or subtracts 1 to the dice size but really good advantages or really bad disadvantages may add or subtract more.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='letsrutrien' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'letsrutrien'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Let’s return to the above example, since our sneakthief is trying to sneak in broad daylight, that means the watcher has a slight advantage, giving him an extra d4! to his Skill Check. Now, let’s also say that the designer of the castle specifically put in squeaky floor boards to better hear thieves. This is also a Factor and now the watcher increases his Factor dice to a d6! instead.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='onlyonepersoncanhavea' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'onlyonepersoncanhavea'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Only one person can have a Factor dice working in their favor at once so if the thief had 3 things going in his favor at this point, the watcher would get no extra dice and he would get a d4!.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'notethatthereare'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Note that there are <strong class='orangeHeader'>EXTENDED CHECKS</strong> or checks where your character is making a single check made over a longer period of time than just the Base Time listed by the Skill against a Fail State Clock. </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'sothiswouldbetracking'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, this would be sneaking for a 3 or 4 minutes if the Pace is set at 1 minute, for instance. In reality, these would be a bunch of smaller checks of the same kind in a row, but, let's be honest, that's super boring and no one wants to deal with that so we've made guidelines for rolling it into one.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='inthesecasestheopposit' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'inthesecasestheopposit'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>In these cases, the opposition would increase the size of their Factor Dice by 1 size for everytime the Base Time is doubled. So, if a Skill has a Base Time of 1 and the Pace is 1 minute but the circumstances for you to do it for 2 minutes, you would increase it by 1 size. If instead it takes 4 minutes, you increase it by 2, 8 minutes, you increase it by 3 and so on.</p>

        <div id='howmuchyoufailbyord' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'howmuchyoufailbyord'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>How much you fail or succeed by is multiplied by half the Skill's Base Time and then added or subtracted from any applicable Clocks. For example, you're forced to sneak across a room that will take you 2 minutes to cross. You succeed by 2 on your check. Turns out, as you were crossing, you realized there was some soft carpeting so you were able to move faster over that area, saving you a minute of time.</p>

        <p>If you have time to spare, you definitely up your chances of getting the job done. Every increment of the standard time for a Skill you add to your Objective Clock, you gain 1 Factor in your favor, but this increment doubles for each time you use it.
          Note that this additional time eats away at any applicable Fail State Clocks but not your Objective Clock.</p>

        <p>So, since Perception takes 30 seconds, if you take 2 and a half minutes to take a look around, you would gain +3 Factor (30 for the first, 1 minute for the second, 2 minutes for the third).</p>

        <p>Prep Checks are special checks made to influence a specific Skill Check that will be made in the future (even if that future is 2 seconds from now).  Note that this doesn't have to be a

        <p>These are made like normal Checks only they’re against a straight d20! + Factors and, generally, you’ll know if you failed right away. Also, they always have a Base Time of 1/2 Pace and failing them doesn't count towards Failure if in Dire Straits and doesn't eat away additional 
          time when your opposition is Active (but, again, it still take 1/2 Pace's worth of time).

        <p>On a success, you gain a reroll or +1 Factor on 1 future Skill Check: this only affects one of the dice rolled (either the d20!, the Factor Dice, or the Rank Dice, if applicable) but this reroll can affect either you or your opponent’s.</p>

        <p>One last thing they can be used for, which is not a mechanical benefit but still useful; finding out more information. So, for instance, if you want to know whether there’s a river you could follow between a mountain range and a lake, you could use a Prep Check to find out.</p>

        <p>These represent static pools of knowledge or information that you can pull from with a Prep Check. So, for instance, a book on the subject, or a library is an example of an Asset but also an old friend who used to be a ranger could give you a few pointers so a Gather Information Prep Check could give you a bonus to the Navigation Check you’re going to have to make to find those ruins.</p>

        <p>Assets have a Time Investment and a Usefulness, which is how long you have to spend to get an extra roll on your Prep Check and what they add to their Check, respectively.

        <p>Another benefit of Assets is that they allow you to do multiple Prep Checks for a single Skill Check and the same Asset can be used to Prep for multiple different checks. A library, for example, could allow you to Prep for both a Monster Craft and History check.</p>

        <p>Assets can also be increased and expanded upon as well, increasing its Usefulness. A good relationship with a contact might give you more information, donating to the local library may increase its selection, or hiring excavators to dig up a ruin may unearth more artifacts that help you decipher that ancient script.</p>

        <p>There may be some special cases where an Asset will take care of itself but you have to check back on it, such as Snaring in the forest. You set your trap and then a day or two later, you can go back and check it to see if you caught anything - in the meantime, you can get other work done..</p>

          <p>Some skills are only going to be useful if you have the proper equipment or the right Asset. For instance,
            if
            you’re not out in the wilderness, you can’t really use Snaring or if you don’t have the proper tools or a
            woodshop, Maintenance won’t do you any good. This will need to be handled on a case to case basis.</p>

        <p>When you’re about to make a Skill Check, you can choose to Stress about it. Why would you do this? Because by forcing your character to hyper-focus on what he’s doing, he can pull out a win, but it comes at a cost.</p>

        <p>When you Stress, you can +6 to your roll, or +8 if the Skill Check directly relates to a Goal. At the end of the Skill Challenge, roll 1d6! for each time you did this and gain that much Stress.</p>

        <p>Players are assumed to be using any and all equipment that would help them with a check and during Step 4, you can choose to have one of these pieces of equipment to give you, in that moment, a reroll one of one your dice (taking the better of the two) or a +d6! to your roll. You can have multiple pieces of equipment apply but the reroll can only be redeemed once per Check.</p>

        <p>For the first redemption of this bonus between Maintenance Prep Checks this comes with no penalty but every time after that, the tool degrades, giving it a -1 regardless of whether you succeed or not.</p>

        <p>You can use faulty equipment (ones with a negative modifier), since something is better than nothing. This still gives you a reroll but it’s on 1 dice lower (again, keeping the better of the two) or on a d4!.</p>

        <p>They do become a drawback. While Passive, their failed checks also count towards whether a Clock becomes Active and on failed Checks against Active Clocks, you multiple the time lost by the number of companions you have helping.</p>

          <p>While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of Challenges as composing two phases: prep
            and action; the planning and then the heist.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
          <div id='prepringisgatheringintiale' class='anchorTag'></div>
          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'prepringisgatheringintiale'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>Prepping is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together, and planning your route of attack.
            This is where you’ll use Prep Checks, Taking Your Time, and Assets mostly.</p>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'actionphaseisiwhenyoullbedoingalot'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Action Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and
            companions - using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get through the sticky parts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>

          <p>But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even during the heist, you might find it worth
            your time to sit on your heels and take your time while doing some Prep Checks as there will almost
            certainly be problems that crop up that you need to adjust to.</p>

          certain circumstances, a warrior can take advantage of his surroundings and combat styles emerge. Combat
          Styles
          can be anything but involve to parts: a situation and a metric. This situation is when the Combat Style is
          most
          effective. For instance, it can be “in the forest”, “fighting on rooftops”, “being outnumbered”, “being in a
          duel”, “fighting while prone”, etc.. Really anything (as long as your GM approves). The second part of the
          Combat Style is the metric is applied to. This can be anything you could normally specialize in. Both the
          situation and metric are selected at the time of purchase
          and cannot be changed.</p>

        <p> When using this means of communication, each side rolls a check based on how complicated the message is
          and how
          quickly they need to send it. Signalling is an ad hoc language with no grammatical rules or complicated
          tenses

        <p> This suite covers the crafting and creating skills. While there are a wide array and breathe of

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>APPRAISAL (specific)</strong> It’s wise to know what something is worth before
          selling and buying it. This skill handles that and is taken for a specific type of good, such as books &

        <p> On top of this, a character can prep otherwise unpalatable or poisonous food in such a way as to make the

          including singing. At the end of the day, the dulcet tones of a neatly played mandolin can ease the ache of
          a
          long day. A character who hears someone play an instrument subtracts 1 day off the amount of time it takes
          to
          heal their Stress per Stress, so, they’re able to heal 15 Stress in 10 days, instead of 15.</p>

          already exists, the size is temporarily increased. Additionally, the Devotion dice size can be increased 1

        <p> Even if you succeed, this isn’t a permanent way of changing a person’s mind. Others may lie more
          effectively
          than you can tell the truth and that may cause them to rethink their opinion on what you tried to sell them.
