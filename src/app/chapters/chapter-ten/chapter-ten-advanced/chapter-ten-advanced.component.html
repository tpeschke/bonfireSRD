          character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a
          character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p>

        <p> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start with only running a two or three

        <p> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though
          typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by
          a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised receive a d20, while everyone else typically
          falls on a dice between that. </p>

        <p> Every action takes a certain amount of time. On a character’s Initiative, they declare their action and are

        <p> So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his Initiative is 5, once the
          Clock reaches 5, he starts walking and once it reaches 14, he’s gotten the other side of the room. </p>

        <p> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when half way across the
          room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d
          rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p>

          <p>To use it, take a marker (dice or a penny works just fine) and place it on your initiative. When that
            number comes up on the
            Clock, you do your action and then add the seconds until your next action, looping back around to 0, if
            needed.

          <p>So, if you attack on second 17 with a weapon with a recovery of 8, place a marker on 17.
            When the Clock gets to second 17, you attack, and then move the marker to 3 ( since 17 + 8 is
            above 20, you subtract 20 from it).

        <p>It is entirely possible that you’ll find yourself unarmed and must defend yourself with a chair leg or broken
          bottle. In these cases, treat is as a club but penalize it for 3 seconds and drop its Parry to 0 for not being
          balanced properly.</p>

        <p>Now, it’s also possible that you have superhuman strength and so you can rip a door off its hinges and start
          bashing people with want and abandon. In this case, it’s entirely possible to do more than a zweihander in
          sheer
          concussive force, however, you’ll find that because a door (or similar) isn’t properly weighted or balanced,
          you’ll find yourself taking a long time to swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme cases like
          these, the GM can give you a Defense Modifier of somewhere around -8 and the Recovery should never be quicker
          than
          20 seconds.</p>

        <p> A defender commits to how much he wants to focus on dodging incoming attacks, both melee and ranged,
          choosing from a bonus to his
          defense in the range of +1 to +5, but netting an equal penalty to his attacks (-1 to -5).</p>

        <p> Additionally, this lowers the range for Near Perfect Defenses by 1, so you score them on a base natural 18 -
          19. This tactic needs to be committed to for at least your full weapon Recovery. After that you may continue

        <p> But focusing on defense does slow you down, since you're zigzagging and trying to juke out your enemy, so
          your movement is considered 1 Category lower for how far you move. So, if you're Medium sized and Active
          Dodging while at a
          Run, you would move at 10 ft / sec, instead of 15. You would still be subject to the damage, however, since
          you're

          between you telling it something and it actually doing it, with the exception of Turning, which can be stopped
          at any time (so you don't have to always turn your mount 180 degrees), but you don't retroactively straighten
          out your mount to where it was.

        <p class="italic">So, for example, if you have a mount with a Turning of 8, that means it turns 22.5 degrees per
          second.
          If you declare you're turning and then 3 seconds later, you decide, never mind, you'll still have turned 67.5
          degrees. A lot of this should be commonsense but I figure it's worth pointing out, just in case.

        <p>That being said, you can lower all of these base times by up to your Riding Skill, however, a mule
          will probably never be as quick on its hooves as a courser, so you can only lower it to half of what the
          unmodified value for that derived stat is. So, if your mount's Turning is 8, the lower is can go is 4.

        <p>Additionally, for Turning, your mount's Speed Category does prevent it from turning as quickly as you might
          like
          with each Speed Category above a Walk adding 2 Seconds to it.

        <p>But, of course, it isn't all good news: moving at higher speeds means that
          it's harder to hit things, especially in ranged combat. For each
          Speed Category above Strolling, you lower your Attack Dice by 1 size for melee
          and 2 sizes for ranged. This can bring you below a d4! and into the negative so
          lowering 1 size down from a d4! means you roll a d0 and stepping 2 sizes down
          gives you a -d4! to your attack. A handy table has been provided. Remember that your Riding Skill Rank does
          off set this,
          giving you a +1 to your Attack Dice size for each Rank, up to a d20!.

        <p>Your mount might also be smarter than you and decide that it really doesn't want to
          put itself in danger. To get your mount to do something that could cause it damage,
          you roll a Riding Check + the Mount’s Bravery vs d20! + the amount of damage involved
          without the mount’s DR factored in. The exception to this is when presented with a crushing
          or slashing weapon, in which case you half the bonus the enemy d20! gets, rounded down.

        <p>So, charging into a pike (3d6! Damage) would mean rolling vs a d20!+3d6!, while
          charging a man brandishing a schiavona would be a d20!+d6! (or 2d3!, either is valid and up to you).
          Trying to get it to leap a chasm with a 40 ft drop would also cause you to make a roll
          vs d20!+3d12!.

        <p>A character falls into the Bleeding Out Wound Category is unconscious and is in danger of dying. This is
          played
          out like a Social Conflict, with the person fighting against Death for survival, Appealing to him to let him

        <p>However, this has a few changes from a standard Conflict, the first is that each round happens every 5

        <p>The second is that you won’t be counting points: it’ll only matter if you win or lose the round. Every time
          you
          lose, you bleed out more and take an additional point of damage; every time you win, you get closer to
          stabilizing.</p>

        <p>Getting to half your Constitution in the negative (either from bleeding out or from additional wounds)
          results in
          the character's death but getting 10 points means that that stabilize, losing no more Vitality but still
          remaining unconscious until they're brought back up to Wounded.</p>

          to
          5d4! again.</p>

        <p>A side without a captain can “defend” but can’t go on the attack, so to speak.
          Individual fighters can also engage in Morale Conflicts with other fighters they're currently

            Obviously, the broader
