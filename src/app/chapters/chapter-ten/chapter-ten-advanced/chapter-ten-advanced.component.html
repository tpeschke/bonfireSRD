        <p> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc, ad infinitum. When the Clock matches a
          character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a
          character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p>

        <p> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start with only running a two or three

        <p> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though
          typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by
          a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised receive a d20, while everyone else typically
          falls on a dice between that. </p>

        <p> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when half way across the
          room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d
          rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p>

        <p>It is entirely possible that you’ll find yourself unarmed and must defend yourself with a chair leg or broken
          bottle. In these cases, treat is as a club but penalize it for 3 seconds and drop its Parry to 0 for not being

        <p>Now, it’s also possible that you have superhuman strength and so you can rip a door off its hinges and start
          bashing people with want and abandon. In this case, it’s entirely possible to do more than a zweihander in
          sheer
          concussive force, however, you’ll find that because a door (or similar) isn’t properly weighted or balanced,
          you’ll find yourself taking a long time to swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme cases like
          these, the GM can give you a Defense Modifier of somewhere around -8 and the speed should never be quicker
          than

          <p>It may be the case that the Party Leader, who should be responsible for the Morale Dice Pool is also your
            main
            line fighter and is already busy juggling an enemy or two.</p>

          <p>You can have a player who runs a less combat intense character, such as the magic user or diplomat, be in
            charge
            of the Morale Dice Pool in that case and decide where to risk dice, however, only the actually Party
            Leader’s
            abilities affect the number or size of those dice are applied.</p>
