        <p> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc, ad infinitum. When the Clock matches a
          character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a
          character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p>

        <p> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start with only running a two or three

          typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by

        <p> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when half way across the
          room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d
          rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p>

        <p>It is entirely possible that you’ll find yourself unarmed and must defend yourself with a chair leg or broken
          bottle. In these cases, treat is as a club but penalize it for 3 seconds and drop its Parry to 0 for not being
          balanced properly.</p>

        <p>Now, it’s also possible that you have superhuman strength and so you can rip a door off its hinges and start
          bashing people with want and abandon. In this case, it’s entirely possible to do more than a zweihander in
          sheer
          concussive force, however, you’ll find that because a door (or similar) isn’t properly weighted or balanced,
          you’ll find yourself taking a long time to swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme cases like
          these, the GM can give you a Defense Modifier of somewhere around -8 and the Recovery should never be quicker
          than
          20 seconds.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>DAMAGE REDUCTION</strong> Armor and one Mastery allows you to reduce the amount
          of damage taken. This
          is often times shorted to DR. There
          are
          two types: Static, noted by just a number, and Per Die, noted by a number /D.</p>

        <p> Static simply subtracts that number from the damage and is done.</p>

        <p> /D subtracts that number multiplied by the number of dice the attack is using. So, if someone is attacking
          you with a slashing weapon (2d6!), and you have armor that gives you 4/D, you’d subtract 8 from the damage.

        <p> Either way, if the attacker chooses to remain in engaged, he then adds his weapon’s Recovery to the current
          second on the Clock. Once the Clock reaches that new number, he may attack again. </p>

          <p>When this happens, the character rolls a 1d20. On any result other than 1 or 20, the character increases

            When
            their number of scars increases to more than the max value of that dice, increase that Trait by 1 dice size.
            So,
            a person who gains his 5th scar increases “Battle Scars” to a d6 while someone getting their 9th, increases

        <p>Whether you're playing a knight or a bounty hunter, you might find it's to your advantage
          to find yourself something to ride on and you'll probably want to know how you can use that
          mount in combat, so here are some rules to help you out.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='yourmountwill' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'yourmountwill'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Your mount will have a Turning, Acceleration, and Deceleration stat: this tells you how long,
          at base, it takes you to turn 180 degrees, speed up 1 Speed Catergory, or slow down 1 Speed Category.
          You declare your intent, wait the few seconds, and, BAM, you've done.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='notehowever' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'notehowever'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Note, however, that you can't do more than one of these things at a time and once you've committed,
          you've committed because your mount has its own inertia that it has to deal with and there is a delay
          between you telling it something and it actually doing it, with the exception of Turning, which can be stopped
          at any time (so you don't have to always turn your mount 180 degrees), but you don't retroactively straighten
          out your mount to where it was.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='wsofroeemxpale' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'wsofroeemxpale'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, for example, if you have a mount with a Turning of 8, that means it turns 22.5 degrees per second.
          If you declare you're turning and then 3 seconds later, you decide, nevermind, you'll still have turned 67.5
          degrees. A lot of this should be common sense but I figure it's worth pointing out, just in case.
        </p>

        <div id='thatbeingsaid' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'thatbeingsaid'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>That being said, you can lower all of these base times by up to your Riding Skill, however, a mule
          will probably never be as quick on its hooves as a courser, so you can only lower it to half of what the
          unmodified value for that derived stat is. So, if your mount's Turning is 8, the lower is can go is 4.

        <div id='additoinalforeturining' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'additoinalforeturining'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Additionally, for Turning, your mount's Speed Category does prevent it from tunring as quickly as you might
          like
          with each Speed Category above a Walk adding 2 Seconds to it.

        <p>But, of course, it isn't all good news: moving at higher speeds means that 
          it's harder to hit things, especially in ranged combat. For each 
          Speed Category above Strolling, you lower your Attack Dice by 1 size for melee
          and 2 sizes for ranged. This can bring you below a d4! and into the negative so 
          lowering 1 size down from a d4! means you roll a d0 and stepping 2 sizes down 
          gives you a -d4! to your attack. A handy table has been provided. Remember that your Riding Skill Rank does off set this, 
          giving you a +1 to your Attack Dice size for each Rank, up to a d20!.

        <p>Your mount might also be smarter than you and decide that it really doesn't want to 
          put itself in danger. To get your mount to do something that could cause it damage, 
          you roll a Riding Check + the Mount’s Bravery vs d20! + the amount of damage involved 
          without the mount’s DR factored in. The exception to this is when presented with a crushing 
          or slashing weapon, in which case you half the bonus the enemy d20! gets, rounded down.

        <p>So, charging into a pike (3d6! Damage) would mean rolling vs a d20!+3d6!, while 
          charging a man brandishing a schiavona would be a d20!+d6! (or 2d3!, either is valid and up to you).
          Trying to get it to leap a chasm with a 40 ft drop would also cause you to make a roll
          vs d20!+3d12!.

        <p> A character falls into the Bleeding Out Wound Category is unconscious and is danger of dying. This is played
          out
          like a Social Conflict, with the person fighting against Death for survival.</p>

        <p> However, this has a few changes from a standard Conflict, the first being that there is no Advantage Dice.
          The second is that each round happens every 5 seconds that character is in this state and losing a round means
          you take another point of damage while success in a round means he doesn't take the damage and gets
          closer to stabilizing.</p>

        <p> Getting to half your Constitution in the negative (either from bleeding out or from additional wounds)
          results in the character's
          death and getting 10 successes means that that stabilize, losing no more Vitality but still remaining
          unconscious

        <p> Each round, the player will draw on their will to live from their Characteristics, while Death will start by
          rolling
          5d4!. Each successive round the player wins, Death increases the size of his dice. When the player fails a
          round, Death's
          dice drop back down to 5d4! again.</p>

        <p>A round can be initiated at any time by either captain, regardless of who has the Advantage Dice. A side
          without a captain can “defend” but can’t go on the attack.</p>

        <p>Captains can draw dice from 3 places: their Characteristics, Leverage (including the additional Leverage
          noted below), and/or any person’s Characteristics that might be involved.

        <p>So, for example, you’re the company captain and you’re trying to convince the enemy goblin that he should try
          and get at your company’s ranger but currently he’s making a beeline for your fighter. In that case, you can
          use the fighter’s Characteristic “You Don’t Want to Mess With Me” to get the goblin to second guess himself.

        <p>If you win, the target behaves the way you want. This represents either them being too panicked or not having
          enough information to make a good decision, or effective leadership and a clear grasp of what’s going on.</p>
