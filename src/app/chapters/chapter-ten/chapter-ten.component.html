        <p> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc., ad infinitum. When the Clock matches a
          character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a
          character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p>

        <p> This can be a difficult when you first start so we recommend that you start with only running two or three

        <p> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though
          typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by
          a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised receive a d20, while everyone else typically
          falls on a die between that. </p>

        <p> So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his Initiative is 5, once the
          Clock reaches 5, he starts walking and once it reaches 14, he’s gotten the other side of the room. </p>

        <p> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when halfway across the
          room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d
          rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p>

          <p>To use it, take a marker (dice or a penny works just fine) and place it on your initiative. When that
            number comes up on the
            Clock, you do your action and then add the seconds until your next action, looping back around to 0, if
            needed.

          <p>So, if you attack on second 17 with a weapon with a recovery of 8, place a marker on 17.
            When the Clock gets to second 17, you attack, and then move the marker to 5 ( since 17 + 8 is
            above 20, you subtract 20 from it).

        <p> But focusing on defense does slow you down, since you're zigzagging and trying to juke out your enemy, so
          your movement is considered 1 Category lower for how far you move. So, if you're Medium sized and Active

          Run, you would move at 10 ft / sec, instead of 15. You would still be subject to the damage, however, since

          <p>Weapon, Shield, & Armor Advanced Trainings are further training in those particular fields, like
            the name
            implies. They can only be taken for things that you already have Basic Training in.</p>

          <p>Each of these types of Training has two things: Tiers, which represent how broad your knowledge
            is (sort of like

          <p class="italic">For instance, the Tiers of Armor training are All Armor, Armor Type, and Specific Armor. So,
            if
            you could gain a
            bonus for using all armors, or medium armors, or a single type of armor, like brigandine.
            Obviously, the broader
            the area of knowledge the more applications but the most expensive it’s going to be to increase
            your bonus with
            them.</p>

          <p>Every type will also have areas you can specialize in. These are the same across the Tiers of
            that type of
            Advanced Training, but you train in specific Tiers. So, Armor Advanced Training has Defense,
            Recovery Modifier,
            Fatigue, and Initiative as its areas. Each purchase in that area gives them a Rank in one of
            the Tiers,
            which is a bonus that’s applied when applicable. This bonus can't bring a negative bonus above
            0, however.</p>
