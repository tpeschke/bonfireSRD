                <p> The battlefield can forge unlikely friendships, healing old scars by inflicting new ones on
                    other
                    people. These characters have put racial amenity aside and have grown to respect each other.</p>

                <p> This Mastery can only be taken by two characters whose races don’t have a racial preference
                    above
                    Tolerate for each other. Their race is considered Preferred for each other, though this doesn’t
                    extend to others of the same race.</p>

                <p> So, an elf and an orc that have gotten over their distrust for the other won’t cause each other
                    Stress but that elf traveling with another orc will.</p>

                <p> Both characters must pay the Mastery cost for it to take effect. Each person subtracts the max
                    size
                    of their Devotion die for each other from the price. So, a human who has a d12 Devotion to an
                    orc
                    can purchase this Mastery for 18 CrP.</p>
