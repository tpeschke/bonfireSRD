                        one basket and it would be worth it to vary it a little to cover more bases, allowing you to use
                        them more often and perhaps leveraging characteristics to bring in others.</p>

                <p> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to notice about them
                    or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I have blonde
                    hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between (“I’m an
                    orc”).</p>

                <p> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views himself (“I’m
                    confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he just
                    can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p>

                <p> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't have exceptions. So, "I'm
                    an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it effect my work" doesn't.</p>

                    you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 6 Traits - three at d4, one 3d6, one 3d8, and one at 4d8</p>

                    <p> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this:
                        either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and try to describe them.
                        These are their Traits and you can crib off them to start with.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='paragraphShell'>
                    <p> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator,
                        which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense but they can often
                        serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p>

                <p> If you want a little more control over your Traits, their strength and how many, instead of just
                    accepting
                    what's on the above chart, you can use your Trait points from Charisma to modify your Traits how you
                    will.
                    You start off with 6 Traits of varying levels: 3 weak (1d4 each), 2 average (3d4 each), and 1 strong
                    (4d4).</p>

                <p> You can then spend 1 of your Trait Points from your Charisma or CrP. This can bring the dice size of
                    a Trait up to a max of a d8. The CrP cost is equal the number of sides of all smaller dice plus the
                    number of sides of the dice you’re increasing to, times two, but this increases all dice (so it
                    costs the same to increase a weak Trait as it does to increase an average or strong one). So, to
                    raise a 3d6 Trait to a 3d8 it would cost 36 CrP ( ( 4 + 6 + 8 ) x 2 = 36 ). Spending CrP can
                    increase a Trait past a d8, however, this is only down after all the Trait Points are distributed.

                    <p> There may come a time when you’re facing someone that’s related to your Devotions. This may be
                        the leader of your family, a higher up in your cult, or the person that your Devotion is
                        centered around trying to get you to do something.</p>

                    <p> In these cases, your Devotion makes you more likely to follow them without question and so they
                        can add your Devotion die to their social dice pool when in conflict with them.</p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'9pUrbBNQrlUv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> These rules may not be appropriate to break out everytime two people talk to each other, or even
                    disagree on something. If you think your character can make a compelling argument that would
                    convince an NPC to change his ways or give him a discount, don’t bother getting your dice out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='9puXdhqeUqmp' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'9puXdhqeUqmp'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> Additionally, if the GM thinks that what the player is asking isn’t probable, they can turn them
                    away at the door. Sure, it’s possible that the blacksmith with give you that sword for free, but is
                    it probable? Absolutely not.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='9pbQqTfJiVZv' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'9pbQqTfJiVZv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> However, it is probable that he’s at least willing to give you a discount. The other person must
                    also see a possible benefit to engaging with you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

                <p> So, if you have a Conflict over a discount, that gives him a window to upsell you if you lose the
                    Conflict.
                    That might be worth it to him, while just having him give you the sword for away for free results in
                    no Conflict unless the fighter
                    convinces the blacksmith that the town is going to be shortly
                    overrun by a goblin horde and that he needs a better weapon to fight them off, perhaps the
                    blacksmith would be willing to part with the weapon for free, or maybe, if he's particularly stingy,
                    he'd be willing to lend it to him temporarily for free.
                </p>

                <p> And so setting the stage for a Conflict is often helping the NPC see what they could possibly get
                    from you should they win.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>

                <p> Another way to start a Conflict is to get a person to act on their Characteristics, such as
                    provoking
                    a very aggressive person to attack you, or getting someone who is a softtouch to give you money. In
                    that case,
                    you simply state that, based on what you know about the person, they should probably act this way.
                    If you're
                    actually correct, you can start a Conflict with them. If you're wrong, you lose 1 Honor.

                <p> So, for instance, you know that an NPC is a known liar so you want him to lie to make a bold faced
                    lie
                    in front of the king to out him as the enemy. You state something along the lines of "You know, I
                    think
                    this guy is just a compulsive liar that he'll try and get away with lying to the king". If that's
                    correct,
                    you start the Conflict.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>

                <p> But let's say that the NPC doesn't have a Trait, Flaw, or Passion that related to lying. Turns out,
                    the man has a Passion for manipulation instead. He wasn't lying because he was a complusive liar, he
                    was
                    lying for a very specific purpose. In that case, you'd lose 1 Honor.

                        who wants to tell the player a secret but also may not trust them entirely or doubt the wisdom

                        through magical means, but this is most often done as part of a plot point. More information is

                <p> Most commonly, The characters have to decide
                    what’s at stake; this is what they’re butting heads about and why
                    they’re willing to put themselves on the line. More importantly, each side has to define what they
                    want to happen to the stakes. If the stakes are high, this might change how much each side to
                    willing to fight to get what they want or what tactic they’ll use to get it.</p>

                <p> You also have to take into account what the other person is just straight up not willing to do. You
                    can't convince a priest to desecrate the altar of his Divine, for instance, or someone to give away
                    a family heirloom just because you want it.
                    Additionally, both sides have to see some sort of benefit, should they win.

                <p> To start off, you're going to select dice that represent your starting argument. You can bring in
                    any of your
                    Characteristics you feel are applicable to how you're going to make your argument, though you are
                    limited to
                    bringing in only one Trait per escalation. You can also bring in as much Leverage you think might
                    help your case.
                    Note that if you're not directly trying to convince your opponent through peer pressure, you'll only
                    be able to
                    use Leverage to do so. This will most likely be the case with Conflicts started to get someone to
                    act on a certain Characteristic.

                    letting you put
                    certain dice into your pool. So, for instance, you wouldn't get a Leverage die for having a hostage
                    while having a Conflict with
                    an orc who really doesn't care about the hostage's life, or you won't be able to bring in your Trait
                    "I'm a gentle soul" to convince
                    the hardened tyrannt's heart by making a heartfelt plea for him to stop skinning all the children.

                    one side walks away, or one side hits the other (i.e., initiates combat). The other ‘wins’ the

                <p>Folding is what happens when you want to try and give them a lie or are not planning on doing what

                <p>If you wish to Fold, you simply state that you want to end the Conflict: you have no more dice left
                    and won’t
                    escalate. Essentially, you’re going to try to end the Conflict as normal, with the other side
                    gaining all the
                    Honor in the pot as normal.</p>

                    haggling over the price of the sword; If the fighter wins that Conflict, then he receives the
                    discount he’s looking for and if the blacksmith wins the Conflict, he sells it at the increased

                <p> The winner receives an amount of Honor equal to the difference between what he put on the table and

                    they put on the table from his total. More on this is found in <a
