                <p> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to notice about them
                    or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I have blonde
                    hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between (“I’m an
                    orc”).</p>

                <p> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views himself (“I’m
                    confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he just
                    can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p>

                <p> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't have exceptions. So, "I'm
                    an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it affect my  work" doesn't.</p>

                    represented by dice of varying size. How strong these Traits are depends on your Charisma. So, if
                    you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 6 Traits - three at d4, one 3d6, one 3d8, and one at 4d8</p>

                    adventure, your character will also grow and change, gaining and strengthening their Traits.
                    This can be done by either increasing your Charisma, which also raises your Traits, or by buying
                    Traits up directly.</p>

                    <p> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this:
                        either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and try to describe them.
                        These are their Traits and you can crib off them to start with.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='paragraphShell'>
                    <p> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator,
                        which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense but they can often
                        serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p>

                    accepting
                    what's on the above chart, you can use your Trait points from Charisma to modify your Traits how you
                    will.
                    You start off with 6 Traits of varying levels: 3 weak (1d4 each), 2 average (3d4 each), and 1 strong
                    (4d4). This is instead of what you would have gotten.</p>

                <p> If you want to increase your Traits further, you can spend CrP to give them a boost.
                    This represents your character spending time developing their personality rather than
                    spending time learning other things. If you built your character in Basic and are now switching
                    over to Advanced, you can refund your Trait buy ups to redo them, but only once.

                <p> Weak, Medium, and Strong Traits all cost different amounts to raise. Why?
                    Well, in the Basic game, there was a very simple strategy to winning and we wanted
                    to keep things simple so you could learn the basics. Now we're giving you the power
                    to try different ways of convincing people so we needed to make sure the numbers made sense
                    and that you weren't "wasting" your CrP were it wouldn't benefit you, so you'll notice that
                    Weak Traits actually get cheaper the more you buy.

                <p> Your Racial Temperament also tends to come into play fairly regularly during social situations.
                    Like a Trait, you can add its dice in an Appeal. But what is the dice size? Well, it's your Honor Dice.

                    8 points to
                    increase that by 1, but you can do this multiple times. You can also spend CrP as well in a like

                    This can be done at any time during a Conflict and you don't have to spend all the increases form a

                    at one time. You can do this
                    once for every applicable Passion but you

                <p>Devotions are a more powerful driving force than other Characteristics, meaning that, if a Devotion
                    applies, you automatically get 1 point for every point you have in it. So, if you approach a blood
                    enemy, trying to convince him to help you, even if you’re being entirely reasonable, it’ll be much
                    harder to do so.</p>

                <p> These rules may not be appropriate to break out every time two people talk to each other, or even
                    disagree on something. If you think your character can make a compelling argument that would
                    convince an NPC to change his ways or give him a discount, don’t bother getting your dice out.</p>
            </div>

                <p> Additionally, if the GM thinks that what the player is asking isn’t probable, they can turn them
                    away at the door. Sure, it’s possible that the blacksmith with give you that sword for free, but is
                    it probable? Absolutely not.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='9pbQqTfJiVZv' class='anchorTag'></div>

                <p> However, it is probable that he’s at least willing to give you a discount. The other person must
                    also see a possible benefit to engaging with you.</p>
            </div>

                <p> So, if you have a Conflict over a discount, that gives him a window to upsell you if you lose the
                    Conflict.
                    That might be worth it to him, while just having him give you the sword for away for free results in
                    no Conflict unless the fighter
                    convinces the blacksmith that the town is going to be shortly
                    overrun by a goblin horde and that he needs a better weapon to fight them off, perhaps the
                    blacksmith would be willing to part with the weapon for free, or maybe, if he's particularly stingy,
                    he'd be willing to lend it to him temporarily for free.

                <p> And so setting the stage for a Conflict is often helping the NPC see what they could possibly get
                    from you should they win.</p>

                <p> Another way to start a Conflict is to get a person to act on their Characteristics, such as
                    provoking
                    a very aggressive person to attack you, or getting someone who is a soft touch to give you money. In
                    that case,
                    you simply state that, based on what you know about the person, they should probably act this way.
                    If you're
                    actually correct, you can start a Conflict with them. If you're wrong, you lose 1 Honor.

                <p> So, for instance, you know that an NPC is a known liar so you want him to lie to make a bold faced
                    lie
                    in front of the king to out him as the enemy. You state something along the lines of "You know, I
                    think
                    this guy is just a compulsive liar that he'll try and get away with lying to the king". If that's
                    correct,
                    you start the Conflict.
                </p>

                <p> But let's say that the NPC doesn't have a Trait, Flaw, or Passion that related to lying. Turns out,
                    the man has a Passion for manipulation instead. He wasn't lying because he was a compulsiveliar, he
                    was
                    lying for a very specific purpose. In that case, you'd lose 1 Honor.

                <p> You also have to take into account what the other person is just straight up not willing to do. You
                    can't convince a priest to desecrate the altar of his Divine, for instance, or someone to giveaway
                    a family heirloom just because you want it.
                    Additionally, both sides have to see some sort of benefit, should they win.

                    That’s what’s at stake. The fighter wants it at a discount, the blacksmith wants to make a bigger

                    Characteristic, if they
                    win, they manage to restrain themselves and you might lose 1 Honor (plus any additional you may have
                    ponied up).

                    letting you put
                    certain dice into your pool. So, for instance, you wouldn't get a Leverage die for having a hostage
                    while having a Conflict with
                    an orc who really doesn't care about the hostage's life, or you won't be able to bring in your Trait

                    used this way. It can sometimes be a jab at someone’s character or an insinuation of skill, through
                    bragging
                    about how good of a climber you are or maybe displaying your weapon in a threatening manner. It can
                    also be how
                    famous your character is.</p>

                <p>Appeals vary in the number of points they get you. When presented against Evidence, the Appeal gives
                    you as many
                    points as dice. You also get a d4! Reprecussion Dice.</p>

                <p>If, however, you meet Appeal with Appeal, then each person rolls the dice assigned to it. The person
                    with the
                    highest total gets points equal to the number of dice but sets aside a d6! for Repercussions, while
                    the other
                    person gets nothing and sets aside a d8!. This makes this a sound move for very charismatic people

                         just multiple the tallies next to E by 3 and add that to the sum of the numbers by A. This should allow you to quickly jot things

                <p>There are some arguments that are so good that they can counter multiple points. These are considered
                    trump cards
                    and should be played carefully because they can only counter arguments that your opponent has put

                <p>Trump cards give a number of points equal to their base times the number of points they counter. So,
                    if you put
                    forward Evidence that counters 3 arguments, it would give you 9 points, while having a 4 dice Appeal
                    that counts
                    the same number gives you 12 points.</p>

                <p>At baseline, the Conflict is simply a battle of ideas, with each side having no person stake in the
                    matter. It is
                    the default and only inflicts Stress.</p>

                    personal image is starting to get in the
                    way. This happens when one side uses more than 3 Appeals in a Conflict or when one side purposely

                <p>When a Conflict becomes Personal, Appeals become more powerful, being worth 1 extra point on a
                    success, however,
                    people often dig their heels into the ground when you start questioning their character, making
                    others things

                <p>This is similar to a Personal Conflict, except that, if you lose and you don’t then escalate to
