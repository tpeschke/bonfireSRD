                <p> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to notice about them
                    or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I have blonde
                    hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between (“I’m an
                    orc”).</p>

                <p> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views himself (“I’m
                    confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he just
                    can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p>

                <p> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't have exceptions. So, "I'm
                    an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it affect my work" doesn't.</p>

                    represented by dice of varying size. How strong these Traits are depends on your Charisma. So, if
                    you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 5 Traits - two at d4, one 2d6, one 2d8, and one at 3d8</p>

                    adventure, your character will also grow and change, gaining and strengthening their Traits.
                    This can be done by either increasing your Charisma, which also raises your Traits, or by buying
                    Traits up directly.</p>

                    <p> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this:
                        either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and try to describe them.
                        These are their Traits and you can crib off them to start with.</p>

                <div class='paragraphShell'>
                    <p> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator,
                        which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense but they can often
                        serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p>

                    will.
                    You start off with 5 Traits of varying levels: 2 weak (1d4 each), 2 average (2d4 each), and 1 strong
                    (3d4). This is instead of what you would have gotten.</p>

                    to try different ways of convincing people so we needed to make sure the numbers made sense
                    and that you weren't "wasting" your CrP were it wouldn't benefit you, so you'll notice that
                    Weak Traits actually get cheaper the more you buy.

                    Like a Trait, you can add its dice in an Appeal. But what is the dice size? Well, it's your Honor
                    Dice.

                <h1>When To Use These Rules</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'9pUrbBNQrlUv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> These rules may not be appropriate to break out every time two people talk to each other, or even
                    disagree on something. If you think your character can make a compelling argument that would
                    convince an NPC to change his ways or give him a discount, don’t bother getting your dice out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='9puXdhqeUqmp' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'9puXdhqeUqmp'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> Additionally, if the GM thinks that what the player is asking isn’t probable, they can turn them
                    away at the door. Sure, it’s possible that the blacksmith with give you that sword for free, but is
                    it probable? Absolutely not.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='9pbQqTfJiVZv' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'9pbQqTfJiVZv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
                <p> However, it is probable that he’s at least willing to give you a discount. The other person must
                    also see a possible benefit to engaging with you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

                <p> So, if you have a Conflict over a discount, that gives him a window to upsell you if you lose the
                    Conflict.
                    That might be worth it to him, while just having him give you the sword for away for free results in
                    no Conflict unless the fighter
                    convinces the blacksmith that the town is going to be shortly
                    overrun by a goblin horde and that he needs a better weapon to fight them off, perhaps the
                    blacksmith would be willing to part with the weapon for free, or maybe, if he's particularly stingy,
                    he'd be willing to lend it to him temporarily for free.

                <p> And so setting the stage for a Conflict is often helping the NPC see what they could possibly get
                    from you should they win.</p>

                <p> Another way to start a Conflict is to get a person to act on their Characteristics, such as
                    provoking
                    a very aggressive person to attack you, or getting someone who is a soft touch to give you money. In
                    that case,
                    you simply state that, based on what you know about the person, they should probably act this way.
                    If you're
                    actually correct, you can start a Conflict with them. If you're wrong, you lose 1 Honor.

                <p class="italic"> So, for instance, you know that an NPC is a known liar so you want him to lie to make a bold faced
                    lie
                    in front of the king to out him as the enemy. You state something along the lines of "You know, I
                    think
                    this guy is just a compulsive liar that he'll try and get away with lying to the king". If that's
                    correct,
                    you start the Conflict.
                </p>

                <p class="italic"> But let's say that the NPC doesn't have a Trait, Flaw, or Passion that related to lying. Turns out,
                    the man has a Passion for manipulation instead. He wasn't lying because he was a compulsiveliar, he
                    was
                    lying for a very specific purpose. In that case, you'd lose 1 Honor.

                        who wants to tell the player a secret but also may not trust them entirely or doubt the wisdom

                <p> Most commonly, The characters have to decide

                    willing to fight to get what they want or what tactic they’ll use to get it.</p>

                <p> You also have to take into account what the other person is just straight up not willing to do. You
                    can't convince a priest to desecrate the altar of his Divine, for instance, or someone to giveaway
                    a family heirloom just because you want it.
                    Additionally, both sides have to see some sort of benefit, should they win.

                    win, they manage to restrain themselves and you might lose 1 Honor (plus any additional you may have

                    letting you put
                    certain dice into your pool. So, for instance, you wouldn't get a Leverage die for having a hostage
                    while having a Conflict with
                    an orc who really doesn't care about the hostage's life, or you won't be able to bring in your Trait

                <p>Evidence is facts: things that are true, that both people know are true. These are flexes in power:
                    I’m the king
                    and so do you a favor if you do this for me. It can also be things you know about the other person,
                    or subjects
                    involved: if you know that a person is caring or has a temper, you can use that against them.</p>

                <p>Appeals are appeals to a person’s emotions, their sense of self, or their Honor. Traits often (but
                    not always)
                    used this way. It can sometimes be a jab at someone’s character or an insinuation of skill, through
                    bragging
                    about how good of a climber you are or maybe displaying your weapon in a threatening manner. It can
                    also be how
                    famous your character is. Appeals vary in the number of points they get you.</p>

                <p> When presented against Evidence, the Appeal gives
                    them as many points as dice you put up but you're considered to have conceded the point, giving you 3 points. 
                    You also get a d4! Repercussion Dice.</p>

                <p>If, however, you meet Appeal with Appeal, then each person rolls the dice assigned to it. The person
                    with the
                    lowest total gets points equal to the number of dice the other side put up and sets aside a d8! for Repercussions, while
                    the other
                    person gets nothing and sets aside a d6!. This makes this a sound move for very charismatic people
                    but it is
                    still risky.</p>

                    <p>Write an E and A on top of each other, and then draw a line between them. When you concede a point, put a tally next to
                        the E. When someone loses a round with an Appeal, note how many dice are added by the A. When
                        you're totaling your points at the end
                        just multiple the tallies next to E by 3 and add that to the sum of the numbers by A. This
                        should allow you to quickly jot things

                <p>A debate between friends is on a different level than two enemies mudslinging or threatening to cut
                    each other’s
                    throat if the other doesn’t listen. This is represented by levels of escalation.</p>

                <p>At baseline, the Conflict is simply a battle of ideas, with each side having no person stake in the
                    matter. It is
                    the default and only inflicts Stress.</p>

                <p>However, one or either side can make it <strong class='orangeHeader'>PERSONAL</strong>, which means
                    pride and
                    personal image is starting to get in the
                    way. This happens when one side uses more than 3 Appeals in a Conflict or when one side purposely
                    makes an
                    insulting comment.</p>

                <p>When a Conflict becomes Personal, Appeals become more powerful, being worth 1 extra point on a
                    success, however,
                    people often dig their heels into the ground when you start questioning their character, making
                    others things
                    more dangerous.</p>

                <p>The first is that you need to not just beat your opponent, but beat his total points by 5 plus a roll
                    of his

                <p>But, it can be to your benefit: the winner gains Honor equal to how much he beat his opponent by,

                <p>Above Personal Conflicts are <strong class='orangeHeader'>INTIMIDATION</strong> Conflicts. This means

                    either the person, or someone the person cares about. You can now bring in that shiny blade or talk
                    about what a
                    shame it would be if that person’s house burned down.</p>

                <p>This is similar to a Personal Conflict, except that, if you lose and you don’t then escalate to
                    violence and
                    follow through on your threats, you lose face, losing 5 Honor.</p>

                <p>But, if you escalate to violence and also get your buttkicked, you lose 10 Honor so if you’re going
                    to start
                    threatening people, make sure you either win or that you’re as tough as you say you are.</p>
