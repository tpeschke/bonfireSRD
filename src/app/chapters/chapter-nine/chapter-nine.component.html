                <p> Traits are things that stick out about your character. Things that people tend to notice about them
                    or that the character defines his identity by. These can be something specific (“I have blonde
                    hair”) or something general (“I have an intimidating demeanor”) or somewhere in between (“I’m an
                    orc”).</p>

                <p> Traits don’t have to be physical in nature. It could be how your character views himself (“I’m
                    confident” or “I’m good at math”). They can also be something about your character that he just
                    can’t explain (“I’ve always been good with dogs” or “I can read people easily”).</p>

                <p> The sky's the limit when it comes to Traits, so go wild, though they can't have exceptions. So, "I'm
                    an angry person" works but "I'm an angry person but I don't let it affect my work" doesn't.</p>

                <p> You start off with 5 Traits of varying levels: 2 weak, 2 average, and 1 strong. These are
                    represented by dice of varying size. How strong these Traits are depends on your Charisma. So, if
                    you have a 13 Charisma, you gain 5 Traits - two at d4, one 2d6, one 2d8, and one at 3d8</p>

                <p> While naturally Charismatic characters come out of the gate with strong personalities, as you
                    adventure, your character will also grow and change, gaining and strengthening their Traits.
                    This can be done by either increasing your Charisma, which also raises your Traits, or by buying
                    Traits up directly.</p>

                    <p> Thinking of Traits on the fly is hard. For new players, there's two ways of handling this:
                        either picture a character from fiction you like or find interesting, and try to describe them.
                        These are their Traits and you can crib off them to start with.</p>

                <div class='paragraphShell'>
                    <p> Or if you have no idea where to start or are just a risk taker, you can use the Trait Generator,
                        which will give you a random Trait. These Traits may not always make sense but they can often
                        serve as a jumping off point for your imagination.</p>

                <p>Devotions are a more powerful driving force than other Characteristics, meaning that, if a Devotion
                    applies, you automatically subtract 1 point for every point you have in it. So, if you approach a blood

                <p>These rules may not be appropriate to break out every time two people talk to each other, or even disagree on something. They’re more of a framework that help you track how compelling a side is and, you’ll find, that you can quietly use these rules in the background as your players roleplay.</p>

                <p>While there are other reasons to start a Confrontation, they’ll mainly be started by you for a specific purpose: things situations are covered by the Game Master’s Guide so what we’ll talk about here is when to know when a player-initiated Confrontation should happen and that’s fairly easy.</p>

                <p>Think of your NPCs in terms of their <strong class='orangeHeader'>GOALS</strong> and <strong class='orangeHeader'>METHODS</strong>. Goals are pretty obvious and map one-to-one with the Goal Characteristics but Methods are how they get things done based on their Characteristics. Methods are kind of the NPC’s morality.</p>

                <p>If the NPC feels like what the player is asking them to do aligns with their Goals and their Methods, no Confrontation happens: they don’t need to be convinced.</p>

                <p>If, on the other hand, the Goal aligns but the Methods do or if the Methods align but the Goal doesn’t, a Confrontation is a great tool for determining whether the NPC agrees.</p>

                <p>Of course, if you think it’s reasonable, the players can enter into a Confrontation to convince the NPC that their Goals and Methods align, but that’s up to you and how much the players are trying to abuse it.</p>
