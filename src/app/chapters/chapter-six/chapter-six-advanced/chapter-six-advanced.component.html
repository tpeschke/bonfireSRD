                <p> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating things about your character
                    so that it
                    can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur of the moment during gameplay. To
                    this end,
                    these rules are missing why they’re important and what you’ll actually use them for but they do
                    reference the
                    chapter where more is to be found. </p>

                <p> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it
                    can mess
                    with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later
                    manifest in
                    odd behaviors.</p>

                <p> Characters can gain Stress in two ways in a lot of ways and those are discussed in their various
                    sections - taking damage, stressing on checks, etc. - the only one we’ll go over here is Stress can
                    be gained (and healed) from acting out your character’s social Characteristics, especially when not
                    playing them would be a huge benefit.</p>

                <p> Stress heals slowly over time but there are things you can do to speed it up. 
                    You have to actively go out and do things that relax your character. There are several things you can do.
                </p>

                <p> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a detrimental way, a character
                    can relieve 1 or more Stress (GM’s option). This means that when a character sees a situtation where
                    his
                    Stress could give him a disadvantage, he can bring it up the GM. If approved, the character heals
                    Stress. The GM may
                    also suggest this option as well if she things the situation warrents it.</p>

                <p> The second way is through hobbies. Hobbies are based off your character's Social Characteristics,
                    but besides that, they can be anything,
                    from whoring it up to spending time with the family or working in their shop.

                <p> You heal 1 Stress for each hour spent on a hobby, though you can only spend up to the number of dice
                    that Characteristic has in hours per day.

                <p> Finally, you can indulge in creature comforts. This can be done by by buying a nice bedroll or even
                    hiring
                    someone to set up your camp for you so you can relax at the end of the day. The rule of thumb is
                    that each +1
                    heals you an additional Stress when applicable. So, a +3 bedroll will always do you good but a +3
                    tent will really
                    only give you a bonus in inclement weather.

                <p> Also, as an aside here; the Musician and Cooking/Baking Advanced Skills also help heal Stress, so

                <p> Rolling over 20 - 1 for every 10 full points of Stress you have on any skill check gives you a
                    temporary
                    Flaw, as your character starts to crack. This can happen whether or not the skill check succeeds or

                <p> When this happens, you roll on the Mental or Behavioral Flaws table. You can modify this roll by
                    adding an
                    amount of Stress equal to up to half your current Stress level. Any Stress spent this way is

                    your total.</p>

                <p> You can then choose either the Flaw you rolled, one that is lower, or one that is higher but if you
                    don’t
                    choose the one your rolled, it has to be one that your character has had before (as old habits

                <p> If you choose one lower than what you rolled, that Flaw becomes permanent and must be paid off but

                <p> If you choose the one you rolled or one higher up on the list, it’s only temporary and lasts until

                <p> It’s still pretty risky, however. Should your character drop to Bleeding Out, the near-death
                    experience
                    makes one temporary Flaw permanent. You never gain CrP from Flaws gotten this way.</p>

                    Instead, you should see a surgeon or a doctor.

                    carrying around only a Light Shield, so your actual
                    Encumbrance is 16. You drop from Fresh to Hurt, and you gain 32 Stress because of it. You're in the
                    middle of combat, so you can't Take a Breather, so you
                    drop your shield, your Encumbrance drops to 10 and you heal 12 Stress, which isn't bad. After the
                    battle, you take a moment to catch your breathe and so
                    you're now only Tired. Since your Encumbrance is now 10 so you heal 10 Stress.

                    you can instead roll a d2 and have a d8! left over, which you can later roll as a d8! or a d2 and a

                    and a d4!, or any combination, as long as the total sides adds up to less than the highest side of

                    you hear the
                    result of the total. So, a character can reroll their defense, after realizing it only totalled to
                    5, but not
                    after he hears that his attack actually misses because of that total. Additionally, rerolls can be
                    used for
                    rolls the GM has made, however they can’t be used to reroll Honor Dice.</p>

                    route.
                    When used, you take -1 to your Honor but gain you gain your full Honor Dice to anything. So, if you
                    have a d8 and
                    call upon Divine Intervention, you just add 8 to any roll or temporarily to any static number, but
                    you have a greater chance
                    of falling an Honor Category at the end of the session. This counts as redeeming your Honor Dice,

                <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETAINERS </strong>Retainers make up the paid help. They often seek out
                    the party directly and have a basic skill. The idea is that
                    the party will help them further their craft and connections for a bit of pay. They’ll make
                    themselves as
                    helpful as possible - such as repairing armor and weapons for the cost of room and board.</p>

                <p>Retainers won’t break contract unless the captain of the party falls into Low Honor and will be more
                    loyal than
                    camp followers, however, they’ll only risk their lives if it’s in their contract to do so.</p>

                <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>SIDEKICKS </strong>Sidekicks are something special. A Sidekick is a
                    person who is completely loyal to a character. They would lay
                    down their lives for a character. A character has a limited number of Sidekicks that he can call
                    upon over the
                    course of his whole life time.</p>

                <p>Sidekicks are childhood friends, people who deify the character, or other such unquestionably loyal
                    followers.

                <p>Any new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is
                    recognized as
                    an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower
                    can be
                    elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character saves the other’s life.</p>

                <p>Even before 50 Fame, a character can search out his Sidekicks, however, they must be old friends from
                    his past,

                <p>Sidekicks start with an automatic d6 Devotion to the character and the character gains an equivalent

                <p>Only severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick but should this happen, the
