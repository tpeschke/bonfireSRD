                <p> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating things about your character
                    so that it
                    can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur of the moment during gameplay. To
                    this end,
                    these rules are missing why they’re important and what you’ll actually use them for but they do
                    reference the
                    chapter where more is to be found. </p>

                <p> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it
                    can mess
                    with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later
                    manifest in
                    odd behaviors.</p>

                    be gained (and healed) from acting out your character’s social Characteristics, especially when not
                    playing them would be a huge benefit.</p>

                    <p> In the heat of the moment, it’s hard to keep track of all the bonuses and penalties that apply
                        to situations, especially the penalties and especially Stress penalties, which change during the

                <p> Stress heals slowly over time but there are things you can do to speed it up.
                    You have to actively go out and do things that relax your character. There are several things you
                    can do.

                <p> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a detrimental way, a character
                    can relieve 1 or more Stress (GM’s option). This means that when a character sees a situation where
                    his
                    Stress could give him a disadvantage, he can bring it up the GM. If approved, the character heals
                    Stress. The GM may
                    also suggest this option as well if she things the situation warrants it.</p>

                <p> The second way is through hobbies. Hobbies are based off your character's Social Characteristics,
                    but besides that, they can be anything,
                    from whoring it up to spending time with the family or working in their shop.

                <p> You gain 1 point of Relaxation for each hour spent on a hobby, though you can only spend up to the
                    number of dice
                    that Characteristic has in hours per day.

                <p> Finally, you can indulge in creature comforts. This can be done by by buying a nice bedroll or even
                    hiring
                    someone to set up your camp for you so you can relax at the end of the day. The rule of thumb is
                    that each applicable Trait the equipment you have
                    gives you an additional point of Relaxation when applicable. So, an extra soft, double padded, and
                    tailored
                    bedroll will always do you good but a waterproof tent will really
                    only give you a bonus in inclement weather.

                <p> When your Relaxation matches your current Stress, you heal 1 Stress and your Relaxation drops to
                    0 again. Yes, that means that the more Stressed you become, the harder it is to decompress yourself.

                    If they're in a scenario that directly threatens their life (like combat or dangling from a cliff),
                    they'll separate
                    themselves as quickly as possible but will pay little attention to their companion's safety. At this
                    point, they're
                    so overwhelmed, they don't really care.

                    deals 1 damage per point inflicted. This damage is all on one wound and is unhealed while the

                <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHANGING ENCUMBRANCE WHILE WOUNDED</strong> The Stress you gain from
                    wounds isn't healed by normal means;
                    it's only healed when either your Encumbrance is lowered or when your wounds heal enough to move you
                    up a category.</p>

                <p> That means, if you took 10 Stress dropping from a Vitality Category, taking a spa day wouldn't help.
                    Instead, you should see a surgeon or a doctor.
                    Now, what you could do is not carry so much gear around.

                <p> So, for example, let's say that you have a base Encumbrance of 10 from your Abilities but you're
                    carrying around only a Light Shield, so your actual
                    Encumbrance is 16. You drop from Fresh to Hurt, and you gain 32 Stress because of it. You're in the
                    middle of combat, so you can't Take a Breather, so you
                    drop your shield, your Encumbrance drops to 10 and you heal 12 Stress, which isn't bad. After the
                    battle, you take a moment to catch your breath and so
                    you're now only Tired. Since your Encumbrance is now 10 so you heal 10 Stress.

                <p> Now, the flip side of this is that if you become MORE Encumbered while wounded, you gain that amount
                    of Stress instantly. So, continuing the above example, if you were
                    to then pick up your Light Shield again, your Encumbrance would raise by 6 and you'd gain 6 Stress.

                    do to speed up long-term healing is to rest and indulge yourself.
                    If the only Stress your character has is from Wounds, any points of Relaxation gained that day are
                    taken off the days to heal off your Wounds.
                    This is somewhat limited however since you can only drop a single Wound's days to heal by the amount
                    it had left on that Severity. So, if I have a 10 Severity Wound, with 8 days of healing left,
                    gaining 11 points of Relaxation, would only reduce it to a 9 Severity Wound with 9 days left to heal
                    that day. However, if I also had another Wound, I could use that otherwise wasted

                    but this is only added at the end of the session if they don’t end with a negative Honor pool. So, a

                <p>Any new follower can be declared by the player to be a Sidekick, having sought out the party, he is
                    recognized as
                    an old friend or a new friend who swears undying loyalty to the character. Additionally, a follower
                    can be
                    elevated to the status of a Sidekick if he or the character saves the other’s life.</p>

                <p>Even before 50 Fame, a character can search out his Sidekicks, however, they must be old friends from
                    his past,
                    in this case.</p>

                <p>Sidekicks start with an automatic d6 Devotion to the character and the character gains an equivalent
                    Devotion in
                    return.</p>

                <p>Only severe abuse can break the bond between the hero and his Sidekick but should this happen, the
                    Sidekick
                    becomes an enemy of equivalent zeal.</p>
