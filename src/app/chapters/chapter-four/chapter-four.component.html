                                        Warrior. These represent the
                                        overall theme of the individual Archetype. For instance, Warrior Archetypes tend
                                        to be good at things related to
                                        combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat focused character, you can look

                                        (3 SP), to increase its Duration up to 5 Seconds (16 SP), and increase the
                                        Saving Throw by 1 (1 SP). Now,
                                        whenever he speaks a rune seal to that spell, he casts it with an Area of Effect
                                        of a Sphere, a 5 second
                                        Duration, and +1 to his Saving Throw roll.</p>

                                        runes. So if the Runegalder has a 1st Degree Flash Grenade and a 5th Degree
                                        Flash Grenade, he would need two
