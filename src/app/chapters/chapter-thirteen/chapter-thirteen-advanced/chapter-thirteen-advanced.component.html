        <p> Divines have spheres of power that represent their aspects. These are codified into Covenants, or promises
          that make with their servants in exchange for a portion of their power.</p>

        <p> For instance, Wülder, a Gothic god, watches over Raiding, Industry and Trade. There could be 3 different
          priests to Wülder, one focusing on his role as the Bridge Between Men, one seeing his as primarily a watcher
          over people going on cattle raids, and one worshiping him as the greater crafter and source of inspiration.

        <p> This means that priests of different cults may not get along with each other and there can even be

        <p> The main bonus of Covenants is that they make Miracles within them easier to invoke. The specifics are
          elaborated on in Step 2 of the Invoking Miracles section. You notice a list of which Miracles a Covenant falls
          into underneath the name but there’s no comprehensive list - players and GM are encouraged to think of their
          own and use their judgement call on what Miracles would fall under that sphere of influence.</p>

        <p> A Cosmic Link is the specific celestial body that the Divine is associated with and it usually gives an
          insight to the personality of the god. The Cosmic Link doesn’t necessarily mean your Patron is primarily the
          Divine of that Cosmic thing. So, a Divine associated with the moon might not be primarily a moon god, in the
          same way that while Venus was associated with the Morning Star, she was primarily viewed as a love goddess by
          the Romans. Still, your holy symbols may incorporate the moon motif commonly to represent her.</p>

          but they will wax unstoppable. For every prayer unanswered, the Priest reduces the next Miracle’s Invocation
          Die by 1 size. For every prayer answered, he increases it by 1 size. This can stack, so failing 2 times
          reduces the 3rd attempt’s Invocation Die by 2 sizes, but it resets as soon as one or the other is triggered,

          “translating” into the Gregorian calendar, in the same way that we assume the characters are actually speaking
          in their native fantasy tongues and not in English. Doing this makes it easier for players to keep track

          Oath is essentially getting Favor on loan from the Divines for the
          promise that, if you get out the bad situation you're in, you'll make a huge sacrifice to them soon after. By
          Taking an Oath, you gain a die worth of Favor for every 20% of treasure you gain from the adventure you
          promise
          to the Divine, should you survive. </p>

        <p>This die is equal to the highest Devotion die related to the Divine you're petitioning if you're Anointed to

          they
          gain a d8! worth of Favor. This Favor can put you over your max but must be spent on a Miracle immediately.

        <p>The Divines are extremely litigious. If you don't fulfill your oath in 1 month + 1 for every Honor Category

          that shares a pantheon with the one you're in and what you do have will decay, causing you to lose 1 Favor per
          day. Priests of the Divine will also condemn you as an oath breaker, a very serious accusation, causing you to
          drop 1 Honor Category per month and preventing you from increasing your Honor. Should you fall into Dishonor,
          you gain the Excommunicated Flaw.</p>

          <p> Short answer: yes. but also, no. Your character knows the time frame of when it will be ready and they
            will
            know when it's ready to evoke before that time, they'll have no idea.</p>

          <p> Once ready, the supplicant will have a time frame to actually use the miracles power. This time frame is
            equal to his max Devotion dice in units equal to her chosen Delievery Time. This means that 1 Second
            miracles need to be used right then and there.</p>

          <p> So, for example, a character with a d6 Devotion prayers for a miracle and sets the Delivery Time for 1d10
            minutes. Her GM rolls a 3. At this point, the character knows the miracle will be ready in the next 1 to 10
            minutes but is unsure when at that time it'll be. 3 minutes pass and the GM signals to the player that the
            miracle is ready. She may now envoke it at anytime within the next 6 minutes.</p>
