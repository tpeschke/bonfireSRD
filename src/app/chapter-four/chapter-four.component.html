                <p> Archetypes represent your character’s background training and starting skills. Your character’s class is a

                <p> Archetypes are divided into Archetype Categories: Expert, Magical, Servant, and Warrior. These represent the
                    overall theme of the individual Archetype. For instance, Warrior Archetypes tend to be good at things related to
                    combat. So, if you’re looking to make a combat focused character, you can look there.</p>

                    (3 SP), to increase its Duration up to 5 Seconds (16 SP), and increase the Saving Throw by 1 (1 SP). Now,
                    whenever he speaks a rune seal to that spell, he casts it with an Area of Effect of a Sphere, a 5 second
                    Duration, and +1 to his Saving Throw roll.</p>

                <p> Spells inscribed at different Degrees count as completely different spells and must be sealed to different

                    runes to cast both. He couldn’t simply bind “Flash Grenade” to one rune and then choose which he wanted to use
