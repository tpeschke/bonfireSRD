        <p>So, in that way, you can have a back-and-forth where people make arguments until one person concedes and
          moves
          onto their next set of arguments about a different concern they have, but, realistically, you might have a few
          back-and-forths that’s interrupted by a line of questions that are only there to get more information in

        <p>Or you might have people presenting arguments but what these arguments attempt at addressing swaps between
          the

        <p>The main goal of this framework is to allow the GM and players to arbitrate how well they’re doing when
          trying to
          convince someone without slowing down roleplaying. It will slow you down initially, as you learn the rules,
          but
          soon you’ll find that you can easily run small Confrontations all the time, without the players knowing and
          without you thinking twice.</p>

        <p>Whenever a player says something, you take what they said and ask yourself “Are they appealing to this

        <p>It will be extremely rare that the two sides will be coming into the Confrontation with a clean slate.
          Preconconviced bias
          can come from a number of places with the most common being cultural or racial tensions but they can also be
          the result of

        <p>There are 5 levels of starting bias. Preferred, Like, Tolerate, Dislike, Hate.
          These are based on how the person 'defending' in the Confrontation views the person who's trying to convince
          them.</p>

        <p>This bias is replaced by any Devotions that the person has that are more specific. For example, two people
          from the same
          kingdom would start as Preferred, however, if they have a history of antagonizing each other and one has a
          Devotion "Can't Stand Her" at Rank 6
          they would use that instead.

        <p>Devotions are a more powerful driving force than other Characteristics, meaning that, if any Devotions apply,
          you
          automatically subtract or add 1 point for every point you have in them, depending on the circumstances. This
          is normally at the start of
          of a Confrontation but it can sometimes apply mid-Confrontation. This also doesn't stop you from using it in
          an Appeal later on. So, if you approach a blood enemy, trying to
          convince him to help you, even if you’re being entirely reasonable, it’ll be much harder to do so. On the flip
          side, convincing a good friend will be much easier.</p>

          <p>The first is that you can swap around who is actually making the Appeal. This means that everyone gets the
            spotlight
            but it also means that the Stress gain is spread out across the party. Since Stress gets harder to heal the
            more you get, this
            has a lot of long-term benefits.

          <p>The second is helping with ideas. Remember that you can pipe up in- and out-of-character, giving arguments
            that
            might be ignored by the opposition initially but then capitalized later on in the Confrontation.

        <p>Okay, so a Confrontation will look very much like a normal conversation and there will be a lot more going on
