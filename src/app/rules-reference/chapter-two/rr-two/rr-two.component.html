        <p>This is mostly when two people disagree, each trying to convince the other to bend but it can also be the

        <p>You won’t break out this framework every time someone wants to haggle but this will be a tool in your belt to

        <p>Confrontations are a conversation: they tend to go back and forth but not always. They’re like a river; they
          flow, change depths and widths; split and rejoin. But unlike a river, they can sometimes return to where they
          once were.</p>

        <p>So, in that way, you can have a back-and-forth where people make arguments until one person concedes and
          moves
          onto their next set of arguments about a different concern they have, but, realistically, you might have a few
          back-and-forths that’s interrupted by a line of questions that are only there to get more information in
          preparation for another argument.</p>

        <p>Or you might have people presenting arguments but what these arguments attempt at addressing swaps between
          the
          different concerns each party has and so what the last person said is only tangentially related to what

        <p>The main goal of this framework is to allow the GM to easily judge the effectiveness of player arguments

          Preconceived bias can come from a number of places with the most common being cultural or Ancestry tensions

        <p>At the start of a Confrontation, the persuader gains (or loses) a number of Emotional State Ranks
          automatically

        <p>This bias is replaced by any Relationships that the person has that are more specific. For example, two
          people
          from
          the same kingdom would start as Preferred, however, if they have a history of antagonizing each other and one
          has a Relationship "Can't Stand Her" at Rank 6, they would use that instead.</p>

        <p>In this case, you'll need to have done something that would warrant taking Stress (such as killing any
          enemy, causing them to
          make a Trauma Check, going down a Wound or Stress Category, mutilating their friends' bodies; any war crime
          done in sight of them or where they'll come across later will do, really, but you can just insult them)
          and then make a Check like it's a normal Appeal. Or you can do this as part of a normal Check if it feels
          appropriate.

          take the highest of these dice. This does mean that, if you fail, you might be getting the Stress instead.

        <p>Emotional States translate to longer lasting Relationships, even after they heal. The rule of thumb is that,
          to change an NPC’s Relationship towards a character by 1 Rank, the player must inflict an Emotional State on
          an NPC that is greater than their current Rank in a corresponding Relationship. So, if NPC has no Relationship
          with you (0), you just need to inflict a Rank 1 Emotional State. This is also true, in reverse, for NPCs
          inflicting Emotional States on NPCs.</p>

        <div id='ruleofthuembeij' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ruleofthuembeij'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This is a rule of thumb because Relationships can wax and wane. For instance, a Relationship can
          fundamentally change from one of trust to absolute distrust if one side backstabs the other. Likewise, you
          might have multiple Relationships with a given NPC, reflecting a complicated history or a Relationship might
          rise as another falls. If you’re unsure, talk to your GM about the specifics about how things might play out.
          Finally, this can apply to a whole group of people, monsters, or things. After watching their companions gets
          slaughtered by goblins, in which a hobgoblin captain inflicts fear on the characters, the characters might get
          the Relationships “Fears Goblins” as a catch-all for that entire encounter.</p>
