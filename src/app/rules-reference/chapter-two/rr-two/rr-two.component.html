          moves
          onto their next set of arguments about a different concern they have, but, realistically, you might have a few

          convince someone without slowing down roleplaying. It will slow you down initially, as you learn the rules,
          but
          you'll soon find that you can easily run small Confrontations all the time, without the players knowing and
          without you thinking twice about it.</p>

        <p>Whenever a player says something, you take what they said and ask yourself “Are they appealing to this

        <p>You might also be able to start a Confrontation via a character's Descriptions however there is a caveat:
          If the Description describe something physical about a person, you can only use it to start a negative

        <p>So, if a person is Patient, you should be able to start a Confrontation to get them to wait. But if they're
          Handsome,
          you wouldn't be able to try to convince him to help you by appealing to his vanity (unless he has another
          Characteristic relating to it)

        <p>Finally, a character’s Flaws can cause a person to do things they normally wouldn’t. If a situation comes up

        <p>For instance, a normally good knight who has an anger issue, driven mad by what the orc tribe has done to his
          hometown could enter a Confrontation to resist going on a murderous rampage and kill all the orcs, every
          single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They’re like animals, and he’ll
          slaughter them like animals.</p>
