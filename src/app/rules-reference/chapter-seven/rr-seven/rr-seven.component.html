If below 40 ft and you roll equal to or under the 10s digit on the height you fell, you sustain an injury and take that many Wound Categories worth of damage, spread over 1d12! Wounds. The injury has a 50% chance of lowering your Movement Category by 1 step per Wound Category of damage you took or lowering all arm-related Checks by 1 dice size per Wound Category.

          temporarily results in a d10! second delay as you try to recover. If you continue to expose yourself to this
          level of illumination, you'll be unable to act at all and will do blind in a number of seconds equal to your

        <p>RPGs give things somewhat arbitrary sizes because things affect you differently when you're different sizes.
          Here’s a handy chart to allow you to ballpark the Size Category something would be in if it ever comes up.
          These
          are given in real life, non-fantasy terms to be more helpful.</p>

        <p>Most of the time this refers to area, but you can also determine size by weight, if it's applicable. A Ghost
          could be considered both Medium or Tiny by the metric - go with whatever applies best in that situation.</p>

        <p>Since it can happen, what with all this Weird running around, the benefits for increasing size are as
          follows:
          +1 to Measure, -3 to Defense, +5 to Vitality & Knock-Back Threshold. The modifiers are reversed for shrinking
          sizes, although you can't lower your Vitality by more than half its base.

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'StatScoredamnNbCfCIEAy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Stat Score damage occurs in several places and it’s fairly straightforward. Then why have this section, you
          ask?
          As a quick aside to keep the game moving.</p>

        <p>The sudden change in ability is incredibly unnerving, meaning that until the person can stop, take a breath
          and
          re-adjust to their new reality (meaning the player can adjust the stats on his character sheet without
          breaking
          off Combat, a Confrontation, a Challenge or any narrative tension the GM has built up), he gets a penalty of 1
          for each point lost to anything that Stat Score influences.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'Soa3toDeCAHrcYcLDq'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, a -3 to Dexterity would net a temporary -3 to Attack, and Defense, all while reducing
          the
          Confrontation Die by 3 sizes, if applicable.</p>

        <p>If the amount drained is more than the score, the person becomes appropriately incapacitated, but not dead,
          until
          the Stat Score damage is healed. To remove 1 -1, you need to rest a number of days equal to the current
          penalty but all
          stats heal concurrently.</p>
