        <p>Think about an RPG session like a conversation: there’s a back and forth between GM and players and a back

        <p>I wanted to take a small aside to talk about meaningful failure because, if there isn’t a chance of it it is
          the
          GM’s prerogative to simply wave the check, saying that the players succeed.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisisjustaZvPUxxbbJS'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This is just a matter of streamlining the session: if failure doesn’t affect anything, there’s no point
          spending

        <p>An example I see all the time is GMs putting the adventure hook behind a check. A man has a job for the
          players
          but will only give it to them if they can demonstrate that they have the skills.</p>

        <p>If that’s the way the session is written; go back to the drawing board because it makes everything seem fake
          and
          contrived.</p>

        <p>For me, personally, it also inflicts doubt in my actual agency as a player. Did I really beat the villain
          because
          of what I did or did the GM just fudge the outcome because that’s what they wanted?</p>

        <p>Something a lot of GMs don’t consider is the idea of structures within a game system.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheresthereSYkNASvrVU'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>There’s the resolution mechanic (how do you determine success or failure) but what that resolution mechanic
          means
          is based in the context of what is going on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='ForinstancecxKCfoIoOy' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancecxKCfoIoOy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, rolling an attack roll in a combat means you’re trying to physically hit someone or something
          with
          your weapon with the intent to kill or subdue while rolling to attack in an interrogation scene is more about
          striking to scare rather than wound.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='ThatcontextiLMPQXvyZgF' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThatcontextiLMPQXvyZgF'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>That context is often nested in a structure. For instance, the combat is nested in the “Combat” structure
          which
          determines how often that attacks can be made while the interrogation scene doesn’t work when you run it like
          a
          combat - you can roll attacks at will, for example, or maybe a single Check could represent multiple attacks.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ButalotofgzFftTArLyJ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>But a lot of games don’t give you structures to run different types of scenes: they don’t give you the
          structure
          that helps you (and your players) play that interrogation scene out.</p>

        <p>Bonfire isn’t going to make that mistake and so the next 3 chapters are going to be 3 different structures
          that
          you can use for 3 very different types of encounters.</p>

        <p>As you get familiar with them, you should play around with them; tweak them, add to them, remove parts from
          them,

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'areconsiderthedefault'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Challenges are considered the default structure since they're highly flexible and can cover a lot of
          ground. In fact, if you're not comfortable
          with using one of the other systems (or you're running a campaign that doesn't focus on combat, par se), you
          could easily use Challenges as a workable
          substitute.

        <p>Ranks represent knowledge. Ranks are used in several different places; Skills, and Characteristics.

        <p>Skills represent broad areas of knowledge (represented as <strong>Skill Suites</strong>) or specific areas of
          knowledge
          (represented by <strong>Advanced Skills</strong>). Advanced Skills are ‘nested’ in Skill Suites.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YoullnoticevVCTeXdqzS'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You’ll notice an exclamation mark (!) behind a lot of dice notations. This marks the dice as exploding, which
          means that should the maximum of that dice is rolled, you get to roll it again and add
          what you rolled to the total.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThiscontinuesQEAnCCJJLR'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This continues for as long as you roll the maximum dice.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoifyourolCIKJzSXdQB'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p class="italic">So, if you roll a 3d8! for damage, you get a 5, 8, 8. Since you rolled the maximum value on two of your dice,
          you
          roll those dice again, and roll an 8, and 5, giving you a subtotal of 34 ( 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 5 ) but
          since
          you rolled another 8, you get to roll that dice again until you don't, adding those results to the total.</p>

        <p>Something to not is that explosion dice don’t add additional dice to the number. So, in the example above,
          all
          that damage is only counted as having been done with 3 dice (instead of the 5 that were actually rolled).</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'LetsberealiSqanQsvLhs'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at once, like climbing a
          wall
          and doing so quietly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'IfthatstheVgwhPsIEvR'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller dice and assign those to each of
          the
          Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided. The total max value of the dice can never
          exceed 20 but it can be lower than it. The other side will still be rolling full d20!s against you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='SoifyoureBujCDMoxMn' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoifyoureBujCDMoxMn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p class="italic">So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a Climbing and a Move Silently
          Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10!
          for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for Climbing.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'OryoucouldjjDqjtWJxxr'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p class="italic">Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and take a 0 for Move Silently. In
          this
          case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you choose to ignore Move Silently but have a
          Rank
          4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope they don’t roll higher than 4.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'EitherwaybetHREgMDvcA'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Either way, besides this, it works like a normal Check, except that, if there is a Stress penalty, you're going to
          roll
          1d4! for each time you split your dice but only use the highest if applicable.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'allivheiwojvew'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>All that being said, Attack and Defence Checks are treated as one action, even if you're doing both on the same second.
          That means that they're going to share the same base dice (barring other circumstances that will be discussed more in <a [routerLink]='["/rules-reference/3"]'>Chapter 1.3: Combat</a>).
          If you're Multitasking with another action, for example, when you split the die, one die goes to the other action and the other goes to both Attacking and Defending.

        <p class="italic">So, let's say that you're climbing a cliff when you're suddenly attacked by harpies. You don't want to fall but you also want to fight back

            to remove themselves from the stressful situation as quickly as possible. This is specific to the situation, but

        <p>If they survive, their confidence is shattered and they’ll find themselves a more neurotic person: they’re
            permanently locked out of the highest Stress Category available to them and their Panic Threshold drops by one
            category as well. Going beyond the last category results in another Mental Break. This does stack so the first
            time, they Panic at Shaken and have a Mental Break at Breaking; the second time they Panic at Tense and have a
            Mental Break at Shaken and so on. If they go below Unsure, they’ve completely lost control of their neurosis and
            retire, a broken man with only sad stories to tell as the rest of his tired life slowly melts away.</p>

        <p>Integrity, or Grit for short, is a measure of how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also
          how other people see them.
          Integrity isn’t about doing the commonsense thing; it’s about doing the heroic thing - being true to yourself. People who run from a
          fight,
          even when outnumbered, lose Integrity. People who let others talk bad about them, and don’t get even, lose
          Integrity.

        <p>The question of Integrity isn’t a question of good and evil; many evil men have lots of Integrity due to
          being true to themselves. It’s more about
          being true to your inner self.</p>

        <p>Integrity has its benefits. Confidence allows you to push yourself a little bit more than you otherwise
          would: tapping
          into mental reserves to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
          During
          the game, you can spend your Integrity points to influence anything, rolls or static metrics, whenever you
          want, on
          a
          1-to-1 basis. </p>

        <p>Doing so lowers your Integrity but might save your character’s life. So, if you roll a 13 and your opponent
          rolls
          a
          14, you could spend 3 Integrity to beat their total. Likewise, if an enemy deals 8 damage to you and you have
          6
          Integrity, you could spend all of it and only take 2 damage.</p>

        <p>If the dice size increases past a d20, you’ll add an extra dice starting at a d4. Further dice sizes will
