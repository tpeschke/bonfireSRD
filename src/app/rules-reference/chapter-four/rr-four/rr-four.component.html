        <p>A Challenge is when the characters have a thing they want to accomplish(an Objective) but one or more things

        <p>And we’re defining “meaningful” here as “things that will either effect the likelihood and shape of the

        <p>So, for instance, if you’re breaking into house, climbing the wall could result in meaningful failure as a
          fall

        <p>Or, if you’re researching a spell, an Obstacle could be taking notes: poor notes could mean that either you
          take
          longer to get the spell or you miss an important part of the shaping, and your spell now has a side effect.

        <p>The Obstacles should make sense: don’t feel like you need to force them or hit an arbitrary number, although
          you
          might find that how characters deal with Obstacles could result in new Obstacles or another Challenge.</p>

        <p>For instance, fixing the serious side effects from shaping that new spell could result in another Challenge

        <p>Failing a Check doesn’t automatically mean that you’re instantly screwed: Failing a single Move Silently
          Check
          doesn’t result in the guards catching you. In Bonfire, there are Complications and hard failures.</p>

        <p>Every Obstacle will have a number of Complications it can gain before it hard fails. This is called its
          Failure
          Threshold. You gain Complications by failing Skill Checks: every 5 points below what you needed to get gives
          the
          Obstacle 1 Complication, rounded up (so a failure by 1 - 5 is still considered a Complication).</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ComplicationsNjEosyQQsW'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Complications represent complications, such as the guard hearing something, or you leaving a clue behind that
          might give someone a heads up that you're there. An Obstacle gets +2 for every Complication is has on it.</p>

        <p>When an Obstacle gets more Complications than its Failure Threshold, it hard fails. Hard failures are when
          something bad actually happens. In this case, it does result in you getting caught by the guards, or it
          results
          in your falling off the wall and taking damage. Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like
          in

          <p>Complications don’t mean that the Skill Challenge grinds to a halt while the players keep reattempting that

          <p>He rolls his Check but fails by 7, giving the Obstacle 1 Complication. In this case, he obviously jumped
            but
            also didn’t make it. What does that mean? Well, York didn’t quite make it but managed to grab the ledge as
            he fell, so he didn’t fall to his death, but he isn’t safe either.</p>

          <p>York is grabbing hold of the ledge so he can't make another Jumping Check, but he does reason that he can
            use
            Climbing. Makes sense to the GM so they roll again. If York fails this time, he falls, but if he succeeds,
            he manages to scramble up the cliff, safe on the other side, but he is working at a disadvantage: the GM
            gets +2 to her roll this time around so he better hope he put Ranks in Climbing.</p>

        <p>Assets can also be increased and expanded upon as well, increasing its qualifiers. A good relationship with a
          contact might give you information quicker, donating to the local library may increase its selection, or
          hiring
          excavators to dig up a ruin may unearth more artifacts that help you decipher that ancient script.</p>

        <p>There may be some special cases where an Asset will take care of itself, but you may have to check back on
          it,
          such as Snaring in the forest. You set your trap and then a day or two later, you can go back and check it to
          see if you caught anything - in the meantime, you can get other work done.</p>

        <p>Characters get a number of starting contacts based on their Presence, with the expectation they'll gain more
          as
          they adventure, but these starting contacts can prove useful as they can be redeemed at any time and defined
          on
          the spot.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoiftheplafLJRmoDZPo'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, if the players need, for example, access to a monastery’s library, one of the players can remember that
          one
          of his buddies is actually a monk there and might be able to help, redeeming one of his contacts.</p>

        <p>After that, of course, contacts can be used time and time again: they're part of the world.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'HowacontacteCivmYalnr'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>How a contact helps is largely determined by the circumstances of why they were redeemed but the GM should,
          for
          the most part, consider them Assets starting with Poor Knowledge and Organization. A player can increase that
          when they redeem a contact by sacrificing additional contacts, raising one of their stats on a one-for-one
          basis.</p>

        <p>So, a character with 3 unredeemed contacts can bring one in as a smuggler buddy who knows a lot about the
          local
          underworld, which would normally only cost him 1 of his contacts, but, instead, he sacrifices his 2 remaining
          ones to increase his smuggler buddy's Knowledge to Good. He can't redeem any more contacts but at least his
          smuggler buddy knows what he's talking about.</p>

        <p>Assets are not meant to replace specific roleplaying areas where you need specific pieces of information:
          they’re
          meant to reward players for remembering to do otherwise boring and mundane things that might still help their

        <p>For instance, if the players are hunting a griffon, they might consider talking to a local monster hunter,
          who,
          though a scene, tells them specifics of how the griffon hunts and fights. During this time, the players learn
          that griffons tend to nest in mountains, so, after the talk is finished, one of the players hits up an old
          friend who knows a lot about climbing and spends a few hours training and getting points with him.</p>

        <p>The first scene is roleplayed in detail while the second is handwaved because there’s nothing specific that
          the
          player will learn that will help them. Additionally, the first scene could also give the players a bonus to
          their Monstercraft roll for remembering additional things about the beast.</p>

          <p>I think it's completely reasonable that players would want to use each other's characters as Assets and why

        <p>On a Skill Check, the first piece of equipment you use gives you a free reroll, taking the higher of the two

        <p>Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at once, like climbing a

        <p>If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller dice and assign those to each of
          the
          Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided. The total max value of the dice can never

        <p>So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a Climbing and a Move Silently
          Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10!
          for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for Climbing.</p>

        <p>Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and take a 0 for Move Silently. In
          this
          case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you choose to ignore Move Silently but have a
          Rank
          4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope they don’t roll higher than 4.</p>

        <p>Preparation is anything your character does to help a specific Skill Check that will be made in the future
          (even
          if that future is 2 seconds from now). Note that this doesn't have to be a Check you make: it can also apply
          to
          an ally's Check (if it makes sense).</p>

        <p>Usually, these only take a couple of seconds but can vary widely depending on the circumstances. Throwing a
          rock
          is a matter of moments while constructing a gilly suit will take a lot longer.</p>

        <p>As long as there is time, there is no chance of failure or, if the players have plenty of time, Preparation
          just
          happens. Mark what you did for later in the Skill Challenge.</p>

        <p>However, if there is a time crunch or a chance of failure, Preparation works like a normal Skill Check with
          success means the preparation is actually useful.</p>

        <p>Either way, you only get one Prep Check per Advanced Skill that applies for each upcoming Check, unless you
          have
          Assets but remember that they do take time.</p>

        <p>That means that if you know you're going to have to make a jump, you can use Acrobatics to stretch, Endurance
          to
          do a few practice sprints to the edge, and Sports (long jumping) to remember techniques all to prep for the
          same
          Jump check.</p>

        <p>When you redeem Preparation that you’ve readied, you can reroll Obstacle's d20, taking the worse of the two
          results.</p>

          <p>While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of Challenges as composing two phases:
            planning and action; the laying out the plan and then the heist.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'PlanningisgaToOzNosgyV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>Planning is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together, and planning your route of attack.
            This is where you’ll use Preparation and Assets mostly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ActionphaseiuWzJLJPHHk'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and companions -
            using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get through the sticky parts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ButdontgetBgGelbDdLb'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even during the heist, you might find it worth
            your time to sit on your heels and take your time while doing some Preparation as there will almost
            certainly be problems that crop up that you need to adjust to.</p>

        <p>If you’re in a hurry to get the job down, you can just rush it. This lowers the time a Check actually makes
          but
          gives you a -5.</p>

        <p>The bonus for this is that Complications you would get from the Check don't get added to Universal or Linked
          Obstacles in the Challenge, though Hard Failures do add 2 Complications to them.</p>
