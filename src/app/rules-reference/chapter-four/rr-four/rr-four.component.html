        <p>Challenges cover a lot of ground: in fact, it’s easier to say that Challenges are anything that’s not

        <p>A Challenge is when the characters have a thing they want to accomplish (an Objective) but one or more things

        <p>Setting up the endpoint allows you to get the scale of a Challenge down, which can help you get a scale and

        <p>Obstacles are places along the path to the Objective where meaningful failure could occur.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AndweredefimntJRoKRRy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>And we’re defining “meaningful” here as “things that will either effect the likelihood and shape of the
          Objective
          or the next Obstacle”.</p>

        <p>So, for instance, if you’re breaking into house, climbing the wall could result in meaningful failure as a
          fall
          could damage the character, making it more difficult for them to perform the next task.</p>

        <p>Or, if you’re researching a spell, an Obstacle could be taking notes: poor notes could mean that either you
          take
          longer to get the spell or you miss an important part of the shaping, and your spell now has a side effect.
        </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheObstaclesQKPnTWxgSy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The Obstacles should make sense: don’t feel like you need to force them or hit an arbitrary number, although
          you
          might find that how characters deal with Obstacles could result in new Obstacles or another Challenge.</p>

        <p>Additionally, Obstacles can be made obsolete by player planning or choice; they can be optional, granting an
          extra bonus but
          not actually being required to reach the Objective of a Challenge; they can be replaced based on how the
          players are tackling things; and they can be player-initiated with
          the players decided to take on extra Obstacle to perhaps gain a boon or solve a problem.

        <p>For instance, fixing the serious side effects from shaping that new spell could result in another Challenge

        <p>At the end of the day, it's important to remember that Obstacles are tool for the GM to use to help arbitrate
          things and
          to provide a consistent and common-sense way of the players interacting with the world.

          you
          to describe a challenge using naturalistic language and then get a mechanical difficulty. "Finding this

        <p>Yes Skills are Skills that 100% apply to the Obstacle. For instance, Mathematics when trying to cheat a

          Threshold. You gain Complications by failing Skill Checks: every 5 points below what you needed to get gives

        <p>When an Obstacle gets more Complications than its Failure Threshold, it hard fails. Hard failures are when
          something majorly bad actually happens. This can either be something that prevents you from getting what you
          want entirely
          forcing you to try a different tact (you're discovered by the guards),
          something that resets you to the beginning of an Obstacle (you fall off the wall and landing on the ground)
          or something that puts you in a much worse position (your lock picks getting worn down).
          Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like

            who

          <p>He rolls his Check but fails by 2, giving the Obstacle 1 Complication. In this case, he obviously jumped
            but
            also didn’t make it. What does that mean? Well, York didn’t quite make it but managed to grab the ledge as
            he fell, so he didn’t fall to his death, but he isn’t safe either.</p>

            use
            Climbing. Makes sense to the GM so they roll again. If York fails this time, he falls, but if he succeeds,
            he manages to scramble up the cliff, safe on the other side, so he better hope he put Ranks in Climbing.</p>

          of climbing the cliff but doesn't want to spend a lot of time on it.
          In this case, she'll just have a single Obstacle, "The Cliff", that she assigns a Difficulty to and has the
          players make Checks against.

        <p class="italic">The second is if the cliff is a big part of the game (perhaps it's a metaphor for one of the
          players). In this case, she's break it into Obstacles based on the different sections
          the players will have to climb: a long stretch (not hard so it's more a test of endurance), an overhang (a
          particularly difficult bit), a part where the players need to jump from
          one handhold to another (not difficult but very little margin for error).

        <p class="italic">She can then, from there, figure out difficulty and maybe some unique Complications and Fail
          states based on the Skills and equipment the players use as well as things about that
          particular Obstacle. For instance, Complications and Failure on the long stretch might result in damage from
          fatigue or scares, resulting in Stress rather than falling, while failing on the
          overhang results in another Obstacle, "Catching the Following Character", that can be attempted by only
          players below that character. Additionally, the jump might cause a Complication where the
          player falls but the rope catches, leaving the player dangling away from the cliff face: they're unable to
          grab ahold of a hold on the cliff but could possible swing themselves back or
          climb up their rope, a harder but doable alternative.

          and/or Organization on a one-for-one
          basis. They can also use points to add additional Advanced Skills that the person knows; Skills from the same 
        Skill Suite start at Poor Knowledge while all others need to spend an additional point to get them to Poor.</p>

        <p>Assets are not meant to replace specific roleplaying scenes where you need specific pieces of information:
          they’re
          meant to reward players for remembering to do otherwise boring and mundane things that might still help their
          character. You can also combine the two.</p>

        <p>For instance, if the players are hunting a griffon, they might consider talking to a local monster hunter,
          who,
          through a scene, tells them specifics of how the griffon hunts and fights. During this time, the players learn
          that griffons tend to nest in mountains, so, after the talk is finished, one of the players hits up an old
          friend who knows a lot about climbing and spends a few hours training and getting points with him.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThefirstscendfLyjyEnDp'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The first scene is roleplayed in detail because the players are looking for details
          while the second is handwaved because there’s nothing specific that the
          player will learn that will help them but there are things that the character will learn that will help them.
          Additionally, the first scene could also give the players a Prep for
          their Monstercraft roll for remembering additional things about the beast.</p>

          <p>I think it's completely reasonable that players would want to use each other's characters as Assets and why

        <p>When you redeem Preparation that you’ve readied, you can reroll the Obstacle's d20, taking the worse of the
          two
          results.</p>

          <p>While it isn’t entirely black and white, it’s helpful to think of Challenges as composing two phases:
            planning and action; the laying out the plan and then the heist.</p>
        </div>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'PlanningisgaToOzNosgyV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>Planning is gathering intel, getting your team and equipment together, and planning your route of attack.
            This is where you’ll use Preparation and Assets mostly.</p>
        </div>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ActionphaseiuWzJLJPHHk'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and companions -
            using what you learned in the Prep Phase to help you get through the sticky parts.</p>
        </div>

          <p>But don’t get too hung up on separating these ideas though. Even during the heist, you might find it worth
            your time to sit on your heels and take your time while doing some Preparation as there will almost
            certainly be problems that crop up that you need to adjust to.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you have a Skill that kind of works but it's not the perfect Skill for that situation: in that
          case, you can make the Check using the kind-of Skill instead of the usual skill, but getting an extra d4!
          Stress. This Stress can't be reduced by Not Sweating It nor can it be reduced in any way via Boons.</p>

        <p>If you’re in a hurry to get the job down, you can just rush it. This lowers the time a Check actually makes
          but
          gives you a -5.</p>

        <p>The bonus for this is that Complications you would get from the Check don't get added to Universal or Linked
          Obstacles in the Challenge, though Hard Failures do add 2 Complications to them.</p>

        <p>Sometimes just having another pair of eyes on a project can give you insight. If you did fail a Check but
          didn't fail the Obstacle with an ally watching,
          discussing what you did wrong with them gives you a free Prep on that Obstacle the next time you attempt it.
          Discussing it takes
          30 minutes - both people's Int scores.
