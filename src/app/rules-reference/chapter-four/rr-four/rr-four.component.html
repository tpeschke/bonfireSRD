        <p>Challenges cover a lot of ground: in fact, it’s easier to say that Challenges are anything that’s not
          covered by
          Confrontations or Combats.</p>

        <p>I know, that doesn’t help, so here’s a more practical definition:</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AChallengeisLWSHfMIAvJ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A Challenge is when the characters have a thing they want to accomplish (an Objective) but one or more things
          that
          would result in meaningful failure stand in their way (Obstacles).</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ChallengesareXVvrzKykIk'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Challenges are a framework that you can use as a catch-all for all the other types of situations that might
          come
          up in play.</p>

        <p>Because these are new terms, here is a high level overview: Challenges > Obstacles > Checks, where Challenges are a conceptual framework made up of 1 or more Obstacles and Obstacles are tools that interact with 1 or more Checks.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisistheObriozjdyrZw'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This is the Objective and is often determined by the Goals of the characters involved.</p>

        <p>Setting up the endpoint allows you to get the scale of a Challenge down, which can help you get a scale and
          number of the Obstacles the characters are going to face.</p>

      <div class="anchor">

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ObstaclesareiRaTlDLQsJ'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Obstacles are places along the path to the Objective where meaningful failure could occur.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='AndweredefimntJRoKRRy' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AndweredefimntJRoKRRy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>And we’re defining “meaningful” here as “things that will either effect the likelihood and shape of the
          Objective
          or the next Obstacle”.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoforinstanOKhUiayPKy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, for instance, if you’re breaking into house, climbing the wall could result in meaningful failure as a
          fall
          could damage the character, making it more difficult for them to perform the next task.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'OrifyoureNJVhvUwMuY'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Or, if you’re researching a spell, an Obstacle could be taking notes: poor notes could mean that either you
          take
          longer to get the spell or you miss an important part of the shaping, and your spell now has a side effect.
        </p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'TheObstaclesQKPnTWxgSy'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>The Obstacles should make sense: don’t feel like you need to force them or hit an arbitrary number, although
          you
          might find that how characters deal with Obstacles could result in new Obstacles or another Challenge.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'additnoeiocie'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Additionally, Obstacles can be made obsolete by player planning or choice; they can be optional, granting an extra bonus but 
          not actually being required to reach the Objective of a Challenge; they can be replaced based on how the players are tackling things; and they can be player-initiated with 
          the players decided to take on extra Obstacle to perhaps gain a boon or solve a problem.
        </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancerPGaRgnuJd'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, fixing the serious side effects from shaping that new spell could result in another Challenge
          where
          the characters now have to figure out a way to undo a negative enchantment.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'OritcouldjutBSkXsStgD'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Or it could just result in another Obstacle. It all depends on the focus of the game.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, it's important to remember that Obstacles are tool for the GM to use to help arbitrate things and 
          to provide a consistent and common-sense way of the players interacting with the world.

        <p>Difficulty is a dice that is added to the Skill Check based on things that might be going on at the time to
          either help or hinder your success. This difficulty is noted just as a single dice (+d6!, for example) with
          you’ll add to the d20!.</p>

        <p>Finally, Maybe Skills are Skills that could apply depending on how the player approaches it. This is often a player 
          not having the perfect Skill for it but might have something that could apply, like using Acrobatics to climbg a wall 
          instead of Climbing.

        <p>In these cases, the GM increases the Difficulty of the Check by 1 to 2 dice sizes (most often 2) to represent that fact

        <p>Failing a Check doesn’t automatically mean that you’re instantly screwed: Failing a single Move Silently

        <p>Every Obstacle will have a number of Complications it can gain before it hard fails. This is called its
          Failure
          Threshold. You gain Complications by failing Skill Checks: every 5 points below what you needed to get gives
          the
          Obstacle 1 Complication, rounded up (so a failure by 1 - 5 is still considered a Complication).</p>

        <p>Complications represent narrative challenges that change the circumstances or something bad that happens that doesn't 
          directly stop the players from getting over the Obstacle or resetting to the start, such as the guard hearing something, or you leaving a clue behind that

        <p>When an Obstacle gets more Complications than its Failure Threshold, it hard fails. Hard failures are when
          something majorly bad actually happens. This can either be something that prevents you from getting what you want entirely 
          forcing you to try a different tact (you're discovered by the guards),
          something that resets you to the beginning of an Obstacle (you fall off the wall and landing on the ground)
          or something that puts you in a much worse position (your lock picks getting worn down).
          Even after a hard failure, you can sometimes try again, like
          in
          the case of falling off the wall.</p>

          <p>For a quick example, let’s say that there’s an adventurer, we’ll call him New York Smith, York for short,
            who

            but
            also didn’t make it. What does that mean? Well, York didn’t quite make it but managed to grab the ledge as
            he fell, so he didn’t fall to his death, but he isn’t safe either.</p>

            use
            Climbing. Makes sense to the GM so they roll again. If York fails this time, he falls, but if he succeeds,
            he manages to scramble up the cliff, safe on the other side, but he is working at a disadvantage: the GM
            gets +2 to her roll this time around so he better hope he put Ranks in Climbing.</p>

        <p class="italic">The first is if the cliff isn't a major part of story: she wants to represent the difficulty of climbing the cliff but doesn't want to spend a lot of time on it.

        <p class="italic">The second is if the cliff is a big part of the game (perhaps it's a metaphor for one of the players). In this case, she's break it into Obstacles based on the different sections 
          the players will have to climb: a long stretch (not hard so it's more a test of endurance), an overhang (a particularly difficult bit), a part where the players need to jump from 
          one handhold to another (not difficult but very little margin for error).

        <p class="italic">She can then, from there, figure out difficulty and maybe some unique Complications and Fail states based on the Skills and equipment the players use as well as things about that 
          particular Obstacle. For instance, Complications and Failure on the long stretch might result in damage from fatigue or scares, resulting in Stress rather than falling, while failing on the 
          overhang results in another Obstacle, "Catching the Following Character", that can be attempted by only players below that character. Additionally, the jump might cause a Complication where the 
          player falls but the rope catches, leaving the player dangling away from the cliff face: they're unable to grab ahold of a hold on the cliff but could possible swing themselves back or 
          climb up their rope, a harder but doable alternative.

        <p>Characters get a number of starting contacts based on their Presence, with the expectation they'll gain more
          as
          they adventure, but these starting contacts can prove useful as they can be redeemed at any time and defined
          on
          the spot.</p>

        <p>So, if the players need, for example, access to a monastery’s library, one of the players can remember that
          one
          of his buddies is actually a monk there and might be able to help, redeeming one of his contacts.</p>

        <p>How a contact helps is largely determined by the circumstances of why they were redeemed but the GM should,
          for
          the most part, consider them Assets starting with Poor Knowledge and Organization. A player can increase that
          when they redeem a contact by sacrificing additional contacts, raising one of their stats on a one-for-one
          basis.</p>

        <p>So, a character with 3 unredeemed contacts can bring one in as a smuggler buddy who knows a lot about the
          local
          underworld, which would normally only cost him 1 of his contacts, but, instead, he sacrifices his 2 remaining
          ones to increase his smuggler buddy's Knowledge to Good. He can't redeem any more contacts but at least his
          smuggler buddy knows what he's talking about.</p>

          that griffons tend to nest in mountains, so, after the talk is finished, one of the players hits up an old

        <p>The first scene is roleplayed in detail while the second is handwaved because there’s nothing specific that
          the

          <p>A rope can be used to scale a cliff but it can also be scaled instead of the cliff. In the former case, it acts just like normal equipment, giving you a reroll, and in the 
            latter case, you replace the cliff Obstacle with the rope Obstacle, which may or may not be better and may or may not come with its own problems.

        <p>Let’s say that you’re tracking someone in the wilderness. You have Hunting at Rank 4 and Endurance at Rank 3.
          Seems like being able to move quickly over a longer period of time, should help you catch the guys, and it
          does.

        <p>If you have another Advanced Skill that you think might help you, you can add it as a bonus, however doing so

        <p>This may seem like it is nearly identical to Preparation, and they are very close. The difference is that
          Preparation is a general thing that applies to a Skill Check you’re going to make in the future, while using a
          helper Skill is in the moment and is specific to the scenario. You can use both at the same time, since the
          help
          Skill gives a bonus and Preparation gives a reroll.</p>

          <p>For GMs, note that Helper Skills are how you handle Skill Mobbing, where everyone just overpowers a roll by
            all rolling against it. Instead, only one person rolls and only those with an applicable Advanced Skill and

        <p>Let’s be realistic here: you’re probably going to end up trying to do two things at once, like climbing a
          wall
          and doing so quietly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'IfthatstheVgwhPsIEvR'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>If that’s the case, you’re going to have to “split” your d20! into smaller dice and assign those to each of
          the
          Checks you’re trying to make, because your attention is divided. The total max value of the dice can never
          exceed 20 but it can be lower than it. The other side will still be rolling full d20!s against you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoifyoureBujCDMoxMn'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, if you’re climbing a wall and trying to do so quietly, you’d have to make a Climbing and a Move Silently
          Check. You could split it like so: d12! for Climbing and d8! for Move Silently, or d10! for Climbing and d10!
          for Move Silently, or d12!+d4! for Move Silently and d4! for Climbing.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'OryoucouldjjDqjtWJxxr'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Or you could just say “screw being quiet” and roll a d20! for Climbing and take a 0 for Move Silently. In
          this
          case, the GM would just roll against your Skill Rank. So, if you choose to ignore Move Silently but have a
          Rank
          4 in it, the GM would roll their dice, and you can hope they don’t roll higher than 4.</p>

        <p>Either way, besides this, it works like a normal Check, except that, for the Stress gain, you're going to
          roll
          1d4! for each Skill they're attempting but only use the highest if applicable. They need to succeed all Checks
          by 5 to completely remove the Stress gain.</p>

          <p>Multi-Tasking is also used when someone isn't paying attention, such as a guard who's on watch but he's
            been
            there for several hours at this point so he's not doing it so closely. In this case, start at a d10!,

          <p>It feels good to help people and Bonfire is all about group cooperation. The fighter helps the skill monkey

          <p>And how you help other characters will really depend on the situation. Perhaps your Preparation can be used

          <p>Really, this will be done to what feels right in the moment, but this note is here to draw attention to
            someone helping you as an Asset and someone adding their Rank to yours with a Helper Skill, and how they’re
            different.</p>

          <p>And the difference is time. If you have plenty of time to coach someone while they’re climbing a cliff
            face,
            you’d be an Asset and you wouldn't take Stress.</p>

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ButifyoureAyuXvnYjdv'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>But if you’re being chased by the guards and it’s a matter of seconds or minutes, you’d add a Helper Skill,
            and you would need to take the Stress.</p>

            considered a d10! worth of effort for Multi-Tasking, though you don’t have to actually roll to see if you
            help.</p>

        <p>While the default is to assume that characters actually care about the outcome of the Check, that's not

          <p>Action phase is when you’ll be doing a lot of the Checks and Stress, as well as equipment and companions -
