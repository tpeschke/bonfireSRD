        <p>Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though

        <p>/D subtracts that number multiplied by the number of dice the attack is using. So, if someone is attacking
          you with a slashing weapon (2d6!), and you have armor that gives you 4/D, you’d subtract 8 from the damage.

        <p>For solid objects, such as walls, where it is easy to calculate how much of the person is covered, a flat
          bonus is appropriate. For every 10% covered, you get a +2, so 25% would be a +5, 50% would be a +10 and so on.

        <p>For people, tree, a moving object, or really anything that’s harder to calculate, you’ll use a dice backed on
          the difference in size, starting at a d20. Each difference in size shrinks or increases that cover die by 1

        <p>Cover dice for most objects works the same as shields - if you’re behind cover, you add a roll of that dice

        <p>If you don't move, however, cover becomes more and more useless as your shooter sights in. For each shot
          against you where you haven't moved, you either lower your effective cover percentage by 10 or shrink your
          cover dice by 1 size, depending on whether the cover is static or not.</p>

        <p>Piercing weapons lower 1 of their dice by 1 size. Slashing lowers all dice by 1 size and crushing lowers
          their highest die by 2 sizes.</p>

          receive half damage.</p>

          <p>While they may seem similar on the surface, these two different tactics have some key differences I thought
            I’d point out so that you can utilize each better.</p>

          <li>Step Back must be declared before you roll your defense while Retreat can be declared after, meaning that
            if you see you rolled low before employing them.</li>
          <li>Step Back moves your character straight back, while Retreat allows you to move up to 45° to the left and
            right, meaning that if you’re going to be backed against a wall, it’s an option to try and skirt your
            opponent.</li>
          <li>Retreat may be done at a jogging speed, while Step Back is always at a walk.</li>

        <p>Combat ends when one side is incapacitated, reached a truce, or have fled the field. At that point the Clock
          stops, and play moves back to narrative time.</p>

        <p>If you engaged in a Morale Confrontation, everyone on the side that won the combat gains the difference in
          points to their Honor, regardless of whether or not their side has less. So, if the players have 3 points and
          the goblins had 7, every player still gains 4 Honor.</p>
