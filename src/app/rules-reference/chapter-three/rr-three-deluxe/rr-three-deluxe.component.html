          <p>The easiest way to track what second you go on is via a number line and a token. For the number line, 1 - 20 works and, for the token, a penny works.
            As long as you can place the token on the number and have it be clear what number it's referring to.

          <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'whenyouiofirstejio'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
          <p>When you first roll Initiative, simply place the token on that number: when it comes up on the clock, declare your action. If you attack, resolve that, 
            and then add your Recovery to the current number: move your token to that number. If you're doing something else, your GM will let you know how long it will take:
          move your token to that number. If you go over 20, simply subtract 20 from the number and place the token there - adding a +20 in your mind.</p>

          <p class="italic">So, you roll a 4 for your Initiative so you place a penny on position 4. When you're turn comes up, you decide to run over to some goblins who're 
            35 feet away. You get up to a Jog (moving 10 feet) this second, and then up to a Run (moving 15 feet) the next second (second 6) and then reach them on second 7.
            You could have either done this calculation while other things were resolving and placed your token on position 7 or just done it during each section.

          <p class="italic">In any case, on second 7, you attack with your zweihander, cleaving one goblin but remaining engaged with two others. You decide, for now, to 
            stay engaged so now you have to wait your Recovery (17 seconds) to attack again. You add 17 to 7, which gives you 24: so you place your token on position 4 and 
            remember to now add 20 to all the positions.

        <p>So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his Initiative is 5, once the

        <p>At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when halfway across the room
          (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d
          rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend.</p>

          balanced, you’ll find yourself taking a long time to swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme

        <p>Whether you're playing a knight or a bounty hunter, you might find it's to your advantage to find yourself
          something to ride on and you'll probably want to know how you can use that mount in combat, so here are some
          rules to help you out.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoyourenotuxMjZSVtua'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, you’re not making constant Skill Checks all the time, Riding, in this case, is handled a little bit
          differently. Your mount will have a Turning, Acceleration, and Deceleration stat: this tells you how long, at
          base, to perform the corresponding action. You can lower all of these base times by up to your Riding Skill,
          however, you can never go below 3 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YoucanalsonbRsbltWIGG'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You can also never perform more than one action at a time, and you can’t change actions until the last one
          you declared is finished since your mount has its own inertia.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="anchor">
        <div id="Turningheader" class="anchorTag"></div>
        <h2>Turning</h2>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisisthebalhXZyWGnpx'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This is the base time it takes to turn one Facing (45 degrees). This is, however, affected by your speed,
          adding 1 second to the base time for every Speed Category above Walking your mount is going.</p>

        <p>Your mount might also be smarter than you and decide that it really doesn't want to put itself in danger.
          This could be charging into a wall of pikes or just a wall. In this case, you’ll have to convince your mount
          into taking the action.</p>

        <p>This acts exactly like a Confrontation with the rider adding his Riding Skill Rank and the
          mount adding its Bravery. Note that if the Bravery is negative, it gets added to the opposition's roll.

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AndfinallytEOlSkWGRux'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>And finally, the opposition will also add dice equal to how much damage if could do to the mount (not
          including DR), though if it’s non-piercing, you’re going to half the damage dice.</p>

        <p class="italic">So, charging into a pike (3d6! Damage) would mean rolling vs a d20!+3d6!, while charging a man brandishing a
          schiavona would be a d20!+d6! (or 2d3!, either is valid and up to you). Trying to get it to leap a chasm with
          a 40 ft drop would also cause you to make a roll vs d20!+3d12!.</p>

        <p>So, if you have to think further ahead in combat so that you don't run into anything, what's the point of

        <p>For starters, if you get +d4! to damage if your opponent isn't mounted or equalizing your height somehow, as
          well as additional damage dice if you're using a weapon specifically meant to be used from horseback (though
          you get this die even if you're on a camel, lizard, or what-have you), regardless of height difference.</p>

        <p>On top of this, based on the Speed you're moving, you get a bonus to your Defense and bonus to your effective
          damage when considering Knock-Back. Should you gain a successful double Knock-Back, your opponent is trampled
          under hoof, dealing d8! damage and allowing you to continue past them. Note that bonuses to Defense are
          doubled against ranged attacks, which are the values in parenthesis for ease of reference.</p>

        <p>For each Speed Category above Crawling, you lower your Attack Dice by 1 size for melee and 2 sizes for
          ranged. This can bring you below a d4! and into the negative so lowering 1 size down from a d4! means you roll
          a d0 and stepping 2 sizes down gives you a -d4! to your attack. A handy table has been provided.</p>

        <p>During combat, a captain can, at any time, state that they want a combatant (or group of combatants) to
          perform
          an action or behave in a certain way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancePIeOnGmpZV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, the captain might want a combatant to switch his Tactic to be more aggressive, or swap who he’s
          aiming for.</p>
      </div>

        <p>He can also do this for enemy combatants: the only exception is they can’t make them run away (which can
          happen, but we'll talk about that a bit later).</p>

        <p>So, for example, you’re the company captain and you’re trying to convince the enemy goblin that he should try
          and get at your company’s ranger but currently he’s making a beeline for your combatant. In that case, you can
          use the combatant’s Characteristic “You Don’t Want to Mess with Me” to make an Appeal to get the goblin to
          second guess himself and go after your ranger.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AcaptaincantVizfxmPzg'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>A captain can affect any number of combatants; however, they need to be easily “grouped”: there needs to be a
          good reason why every combatant “targeted” would be affected by the same Appeal.</p>

        <p>If one side has a captain but they're removed from combat for any reason (including going unconscious) with

        <p>If they don't have any applicable personal Characteristics or Skills, they at least get a Check but gain
          double the Stress they normally take (2d4!), which can only be reduced by 1 dice if the difference is greater

        <p>So, for goblins, having no warfare, no Presence, or no Intellect, they would auto-fail but if you’re facing
          an ettin and try to intimidate him based on strength, he would roll based on its strength (and maybe some

        <p>Normally, running away is only caused by a combatant reaching their Stress Threshold, but, with no captain,
          any
          Panicked or Fatigued combatant can be convinced to turn tail and run, inflicting any Stress they would gain on
          the
          remaining

          <p>As noted, you can use a Confrontation just to inflict your opponent any with Stress. The same is also true
            for Morale Confrontations. Sometimes, it's not about forcing your opponent into making a

          <p>This can pair this with an action (such as brutalizing a fallen foe or gloating over a kill) or it can be
            an independent action (Like screaming in your enemy's face) or it can be issuing orders (to have a companion
            change their combat tactic before their attack is up) but either way, it takes a base of 1d4! seconds.</p>
