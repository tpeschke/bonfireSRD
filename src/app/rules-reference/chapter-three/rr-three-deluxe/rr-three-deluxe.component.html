          balanced, you’ll find yourself taking a long time to swing and unable to defend yourself properly. In extreme

        <p>A Perfect Attack or Defense is one that puts you in a better position to win. A Perfect Attack occurs on an
          unmodified roll of 20 on your Attack roll, while a Perfect Defense is an unmodified 20 on your Defense roll,
          but only if your final totals are still greater than your opponent’s. If not, the attack still hits for
          Perfect
          Attacks and you still dodge the blow for Perfect Defenses but you don’t gain the auxiliary benefits.</p>

        <p>The attacker rolls their damage and subtracts the shield or weapon’s DR (2/d DR for weapons),

        <p>A defender commits to how much he wants to focus on dodging incoming attacks, both melee and ranged, choosing
          from a bonus to his defense in the range of +1 to +5, but netting an equal penalty to his attacks (-1 to -5).

        <p>Additionally, this increases the range for Near Perfect Defenses by 1, so you score them on a base natural 18
          -
          19. This tactic needs to be committed to for at least your full weapon Recovery. After that you may continue

        <p>But focusing on defense does slow you down, since you're zigzagging and trying to juke out your enemy, so
          your movement is considered 1 Category lower for how far you move. So, if you're Medium sized and Active

        <p>Whether you're playing a knight or a bounty hunter, you might find it's to your advantage to find yourself
          something to ride on and you'll probably want to know how you can use that mount in combat, so here are some
          rules to help you out.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SoyourenotuxMjZSVtua'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, you’re not making constant Skill Checks all the time, Riding, in this case, is handled a little bit
          differently. Your mount will have a Turning, Acceleration, and Deceleration stat: this tells you how long, at
          base, to perform the corresponding action. You can lower all of these base times by up to your Riding Skill,
          however, you can never go below 3 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>
        <div id='YoucanalsonbRsbltWIGG' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YoucanalsonbRsbltWIGG'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>You can also never perform more than one action at a time, and you can’t change actions until the last one
          you declared is finished since your mount has its own inertia.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="anchor">
        <div id="Turningheader" class="anchorTag"></div>
        <h2>Turning</h2>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisisthebalhXZyWGnpx'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This is the base time it takes to turn one Facing (45 degrees). This is, however, affected by your speed,
          adding 1 second to the base time for every Speed Category above Walking your mount is going.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThismovesyouzxnCkbWtUY'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This moves your mount up or down 1 Speed Category, respectively.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'YourmountmigEdypPGajcV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Your mount might also be smarter than you and decide that it really doesn't want to put itself in danger.
          This could be charging into a wall of pikes or just a wall. In this case, you’ll have to convince your mount
          into taking the action.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ThisactsexaclMtalEDwvm'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>This acts exactly like a Morale Conflict with the rider adding his Riding Skill as an additional dice and the
          mount adding its Bravery. Note that if the Bravery is a negative dice, it gets added to the oppositions roll.
        </p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'AndfinallytEOlSkWGRux'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>And finally, the opposition will also add dice equal to how much damage if could do to the mount (not
          including DR), though if it’s non-piercing, you’re going to half the damage dice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor marginBottom'>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SincethisisMaOqvPjfJp'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>Since this is an Appeal, Stress is still given out to both rider and mount.</p>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'SochargingisqDjHcCzat'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>So, charging into a pike (3d6! Damage) would mean rolling vs a d20!+3d6!, while charging a man brandishing a
          schiavona would be a d20!+d6! (or 2d3!, either is valid and up to you). Trying to get it to leap a chasm with
          a 40 ft drop would also cause you to make a roll vs d20!+3d12!.</p>

        <p>So, if you have to think further ahead in combat so that you don't run into anything, what's the point of
          using a mount? 1) because it's awesome and 2) you get a lot of extra bonuses for doing so.</p>

        <p>For starters, if you get +d4! to damage if your opponent isn't mounted or equalizing your height somehow, as
          well as additional damage dice if you're using a weapon specifically meant to be used from horseback (though
          you get this die even if you're on a camel, lizard, or what-have you), regardless of height difference.</p>

        <p>On top of this, based on the Speed you're moving, you get a bonus to your Defense and bonus to your effective
          damage when considering Knock-Back. Should you gain a successful double Knock-Back, your opponent is trampled
          under hoof, dealing d8! damage and allowing you to continue past them. Note that bonuses to Defense are

        <p>For each Speed Category above Strolling, you lower your Attack Dice by 1 size for melee and 2 sizes for
          ranged. This can bring you below a d4! and into the negative so lowering 1 size down from a d4! means you roll
          a d0 and stepping 2 sizes down gives you a -d4! to your attack. A handy table has been provided.</p>

        <p>During combat, a captain can, at any time, state that they want a combatant (or group of combatants) to
          perform
          an action or behave in a certain way.</p>
      </div>

        <app-bm-chapter-icon [id]="'ForinstancePIeOnGmpZV'"></app-bm-chapter-icon>
        <p>For instance, the captain might want a combatant to switch his Tactic to be more aggressive, or swap who he’s
          aiming for.</p>

        <p>He can also do this for enemy combatants: the only exception is they can’t make them run away (which can
          happen, but we'll talk about that a bit later).</p>

        <p>So, for example, you’re the company captain and you’re trying to convince the enemy goblin that he should try
          and get at your company’s ranger but currently he’s making a beeline for your combatant. In that case, you can
          use the combatant’s Characteristic “You Don’t Want to Mess with Me” to make an Appeal to get the goblin to
          second guess himself and go after your ranger.</p>

        <p>A captain can affect any number of combatants; however, they need to be easily “grouped”: there needs to be a
          good reason why every combatant “targeted” would be affected by the same Appeal.</p>

        <p>If one side has a captain but they're removed from combat for any reason (including going unconscious) with
          no replacement, everyone on their side immediately has their Panic Threshold lowered by 1 Category, so

        <p>A side with no captain can’t actively go “on the attack”, meaning that they can no longer initiate a

        <p>If they don't have any applicable personal Characteristics or Skills, they at least get a Check but gain
          double the Stress they normally take (2d4!), which can only be reduced by 1 dice if the difference is greater than 5.</p>

        <p>So, for goblins, having no warfare, no Presence, or no Intellect, they would auto-fail but if you’re facing
          an ettin and try to intimidate him based on strength, he would roll based on its strength (and maybe some

        <p>Normally, running away is only caused by a combatant reaching their Stress Threshold, but, with no captain,
          any
          Panicked or Fatigued combatant can be convinced to turn tail and run, inflicting any Stress they would gain on the
          remaining
          combatants. All combatants that are both Fatigued and Panicked will automatically run.</p>

          <p>As noted, you can use a Confrontation just to inflict your opponent any with Stress. The same is also true for Morale Confrontations. Sometimes, it's not about forcing your opponent into making a 
            tactical error: sometimes it's just about breaking their spirit.

        <p>On top of that you’ll also have additional places you can pull from for your arguments that only really apply
