                <p> The purpose of this chapter is to condense all the rules for calculating things about your character so that it
                    can keep the other chapters to just rules you’ll need at the spur of the moment during gameplay. To this end,
                    these rules are missing why they’re important and what you’ll actually use them for but they do reference the
                    chapter where more is to be found. </p>

                <p> Honor is a measure how not only how a person measures their own integrity but also how other people see them.
                    Honor isn’t about doing the common sense thing; it’s about doing the heroic thing. People who run from a fight,
                    even when outnumbered, lose Honor. People who let others talk bad about them and don’t get even lose Honor.</p>

                    after he hears that his attack actually misses because of that total. Additionally, rerolls can be used for

                <p> You gain Fame by doing things. This is primarily from completing Goals and Benchmarks but it can be from
                    completing quests and simply bragging about your exploits in the local tavern.</p>

                <div id='6pJbidDiCcgI' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <p> The reason that Goals gain you more Fame than if you were just running around doing random fetch quests is
                    because completing Goals creates a story that people want to talk about. Sure, they can talk about you slaying
                    that dragon, but if it’s also the dragon that kidnapped your sister, that’s much more compelling and worth
                    gossiping about at the local watering hole.</p>

                <p> At the end of each session, for every 10 points of Fame a character has, they gain an additional Honor point,
                    but this is only added at the end of the session if they don’t end with a negative Honor pool. So, a character
                    with 70 Fame that ends with -3 Honor, drops an Honor Category at the end of the session. </p>

                <p> After separating himself from the situation that caused him to Fatigue, a character halfs his Fatigue Level if
                    given an hour of rest, however, that’s as far down as he can drop it that day. If he gains Fatigue later that
                    day and then rests, that rest only gets rid of half the Fatigue he gains since his previous rest.</p>

                    Wounds has a total of 8 Fatigue. He then gets a rest, which drops his Fatigue to 5 ( (6 / 2) + 2 ). If he then
                    gets into a race and gains another 3 Fatigue, resting after will drop him to 7 from 8 ( 5 from his Wounds and
                    previous Fatigue + ( 3 / 2 ) ) Fatigue. </p>

                    left to heal. Taking from the above example, our character, after a good night sleep (assuming the day's healing
                    hasn't dropped him a Wound Category) will have a Fatigue of 0, giving him no penalties, but not returning him to

                <p> Working under pressure can get to you. When your crew mates are relying on you to pull out a win, it can mess
                    with your head. Your character can become stressed under these circumstances and stress can later manifest in

                <p> Characters can gain Stress in two ways: the first is by suppressing their nature. Stress is given out when

                <p> The second way is to take Stress on upon yourself. Why would you do this? Because by forcing your character to
                    hyper-focus on what he’s doing, he can pull out a win, but the Stress will get to him.</p>

                <p> Characters who stress about a skill check automatically succeed, however, they take 1 point of Stress for every

                <p> However, it gets a bit trickier when it comes to opposed checks. In this case, it becomes a bit like gamble. The
                    character with the lowest Wisdom goes first, declaring how much Stress he is willing to take. The other
                    character then decides to either raise, in which case they must declare to take on an amount of Stress equal to
                    at least their opponent +1, or hold, in which case they commit not to stress any more about the skill challenge.

                <p> If he raises, his opponent may then raise or hold. This goes back and forth until either one person holds, or
                    one character maxes out his Stress. The max Stress a character can bet is equal to his Wisdom score.</p>

                <div id='6pjjJRXpcTRN' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <p> Once this happens, the rolls are made, each adding 1 point to their roll for every point of Stress committed to.
                    Each character takes the amount of Stress they committed to whether or not they ended up succeeding at the

                <p> Rolling over 20 - 1 for every 10 full points of Stress you have on any skill check gives you a temporary Flaw,

                <div id='6poPxElbesDC' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <p> When this happens, you roll on the Mental or Behavioral Flaws table. You can modify this roll by adding an
                    amount of Stress equal to up to half your current Stress level. Any Stress spent this way is subtracted from
                    your total.</p>

                    the one your rolled, it has to be one that your character has had before (as old habits resurface).</p>

                <p> It’s still pretty risky, however. Should your character drop below 0 Healths, the near-death experience makes
                    one temporary Flaw permanent. You never gain CrP from Flaws gotten this way.</p>

                <p> Stress also affects three things: Morale, lowering the character's Morale Threshold by 1 per 1 Stress, and
                    healing.</p>

                <p> For every 10 points of Stress a character has, he adds 1 day of healing time to every wound at every level. So,
                    a character with 5 severity wound would normally heal completely in 15 days, however if he was dealing with 23
                    points of Stress, he’d only heal completely after 25 days.</p>

                <p> Additionally, every 10 points add 1 to the character’s Fatigue Score as well.</p>

                <p> Stress heals slowly and the more you have, the slower it heals. Stress heals in a compound fashion, with 1
                    Stress healing after a number of days equal to the total Stress. So, 5 points of Stress takes 5 days to drop to
                    4 Stress, and a total of 15 days to heal completely. All Stress is added to the same total.</p>

                <p> There is two ways for a character to decompress and speed up healing Stress.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='6pvpSjZesCVW' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <p> The first is to give into his nature. By role playing his Flaws in a detrimental way, a character can relieve 1
                    or more Stress (GM’s option).</p>
            </div>
            <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
                <div id='6pzmbdCQDkgY' class='anchorTag'></div>
                <p> The second way is through hobbies. After spending leisure time, your character can check against the relevant
                    social attribute (Traits/Passions/Devotions) that the hobby reflects. On a 4 or above on any dice, your
                    character heals 1 Stress. Once you’ve failed on a check, you may not try that attribute again till you’ve moved
                    through all your characteristics, but each try requires more down time spent.</p>
