        <p> The Clock begins at 1, and then progresses to 2, 3, 4 etc, ad infinitum. When the Clock matches a
          character’s Initiative, they go. Each of these numbers represent 1 second of time passing. What second a
          character's next action is referred to as their initiative (or "where they are on the Clock") </p>

        <p> Each side rolls an initiative die. The lower the die, the more prepared they are for the attack, though
          typically the instigator goes on second 1. Those that know the battle is about to start (like being warned by
          a predetermined sign) use a d4, and the completely surprised receive a d20, while everyone else typically
          falls on a dice between that. </p>

        <p> Every action takes a certain amount of time. On a character’s Initiative, they declare their action and are
          told how long that action will take. After that time, the action is complete.</p>

      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pbJXYhjEAze' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> So, if a character wants to walk across a room, which will take 8 seconds, and his Initiative is 5, once the
          Clock reaches 5, he starts walking and once it reaches 14, he’s gotten the other side of the room. </p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pVLtimeLjlY' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> At any point, you may choose to forfeit your action and change your course. If, when half way across the
          room (at second 9), the character sees that his buddy is in trouble, he can immediately decide that, no, he’d
          rather be there, his character stops walking across the room and instead heads over to help his friend. </p>

        <h4>🜂 Advanced Rule</h4>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pcjGEeSfxwC' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> These rules add another layer of strategy to combat and should be implemented as soon as you have the basics
          down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pCXszfTFbaD' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> A combatant utilizing these moves can only commit to one at a time, unless otherwise stated and can only
          switch on their attack unless it says otherwise.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="space"></div>
      <div class='paragraphShell'>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>CALLED SHOT</strong> By carefully aiming your shot, a character can reduce the effects of heavy armor by taking more time to target gaps.
        When imploying this tactic, a character halves their effective number of damage dice (rounded up) for considering /D DR, however, it takes a bit longer to set up the strike and so they increase their 
      speed by 3 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell'>
        <p>Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pOcwuHBqCJG' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHARGE</strong> A character moving at least a Run can throw their full force
          behind a blow, knocking their opponent off their guard. If the Attacker has reach, the damage for their next
          attack is considered doubled for the purposes of determining Knock-Backs, though they defend with a d12! for
          half their weapon speed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10phqEwWEYFwZ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> A charge is a terrifying tactic: should the blow land, the target’s Morale drops by 1 for every point the
          attacker hits by.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pNRQBQaKKHa' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>CHOKING UP ON YOUR WEAPON</strong> When you’ve choked up on your weapon, your
          weapon’s Measure is halved, and you add that number, rounded down to its speed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pQJofMLfjZy' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> However, if an opponent is in your guard and you choke up on your weapon, you defend with a standard 1d20!
          and deal full weapon damage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10poNFeStKzDW' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> You’re unable to employ this tactic twice if someone again gets within your guard.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pDTgJWpJYDu' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>FEINT</strong> When performing this move, you (hopefully) get your enemy to
          commit his guard to a different location than you plan on hitting. </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pszTyGrCtuA' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Before you roll, if you declare a Feint, you receive a +5 to that Attack but receive a -3 to Defense until
          your next attack. </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pKdXtBpqWzC' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>FLURRY of BLOWS</strong> This tactic involves releasing a rain of quick attacks
          that rely more on speed than accuracy or power.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10phfYxZodDmI' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> While employing this tactic, you attack 3 seconds quicker, however, you suffer a -3 to Attack, your damage
          doesn’t explode, and attacks inflict a level of Fatigue if the attack die rolls under your Fatigue Score.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10puAkKluidcM' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>JAB</strong> A strike that is meant to purposely to open your opponent’s guard
          and get them off their balance by making them shift their defense.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pirAJcbUMIN' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> The Jab attack happens at half weapon speed (rounded up) for Piercing and Slashing weapons. Instead of a
          d20!, the defender uses a d12! but on a successful hit, no damage is done, and the defender nets a -1 to their
          next full defense against a non-jab attack. This penalty doubles with each jab, however, it only lasts until
          the defender’s next full defense.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pgLbKIrczAE' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Crushing weapons may use this tactic but it’s not any faster than their regular speed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10prXImsSruPH' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>LONG GUARD</strong> By placing your weapon further out in front of you and
          trying to line the body of the weapon with the defender’s eye line, this may allow a person with a short
          weapon the first strike.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pleayrXOFfV' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> While using this tactic, you increase your weapon’s measure by 1/2 ft but you reduce your damage’s largest
          die by 1 size.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pdbgkAUpmxq' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Crushing weapons are unable to employ this tactic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pNxFYFHKBbJ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>ACTIVE DODGING</strong> This move relays on actively focusing on dodging against
          incoming attacks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pCPWHGfSWZj' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> A defender commits to how much he wants to focus on dodging incoming attacks, choosing from a bonus to his
          defense in the range of +1 to +5, but netting an equal penalty to his attacks (-1 to -5).</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pybxERnWaTB' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Additionally, this lowers the range for Near Perfect Defenses by 1, so you score them on a base natural 18 -
          19. This tactic needs to be committed to for at least your full weapon speed. After that you may continue
          using it and change tactics at any point.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pzSrSvOJoba' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Active Dodging can be combined with Retreat and Step Back, adding their defense and attack penalties on top
          of each other.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pWUlileFpWg' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>POWER ATTACK</strong> This is the fighting equivalent of baseball batting your
          enemy, swinging with all your might.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10puMeXwVJlzG' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> With this attack, you receive a -3 to your Attack and next defense but your damage increases</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10phulDFNYlEZ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Piercing weapons increase 1 die by 1 size. Slashing weapons increase all dice by 1 size and crushing weapons
          increase its highest die by 2 sizes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10puqFpIclXtS' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>RETREAT</strong> This is a defensive tactic that involves moving directly back
          or at a 45 degree angle from your opponent’s blows at a speed up to your jog.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pHAkXGOUADw' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> After you defense roll, if you declare a Retreat, you receive a +5 to your next Defense roll but also a -5
          to your next Attack.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pwwtfLgYsBn' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> If your opponent is using the Flurry of Blows, Feint, or the Power Attack tactic, if they do hit, you only
          receive half damage</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10peALrCCPVQe' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>SHIFT</strong> You move at your walking speed to either side of your opponent,
          but suffer a -1 to your next Attack and Defense for every 5 ft you travel before your next Attack or Defense.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pKHrpcMcwNK' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> However, if you Shift with another tactic, you don’t receive this penalty and gain a +1 that can be either
          used to increase a bonus or decrease a penalty from that tactic. You may do this freely with any tactic except
          Retreat and Step Back.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pXwAsMvDDNM' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Shifting is also used to changed Facings.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pzIeitmfMbw' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>STEP BACK</strong> This is a defensive tactic that involves moving directly back
          from your opponent’s blows at your walking speed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pgTLNeNYfGf' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Before your defense roll, if you declare a Step Back, you receive a +5 to your next Defense roll but also a

        <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
          <div id='10pocvEGvmpxa' class='anchorTag'></div>
          <p> While they may seem similar on the surface, these two different tactics have some key differences I
            thought I’d point out so that you can utilize each better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="space"></div>
        <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
          <div id='10pMRcLBoGJvM' class='anchorTag'></div>
          <p> 1. Step Back must be declared before you roll your defense while Retreat can be declared after, meaning
            that if you see you rolled low before employing them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
          <div id='10paxujFHSFOm' class='anchorTag'></div>
          <p> 2. Step Back moves your character straight back, while Retreat allows you to move up to 45° to the left
            and right, meaning that if you’re going to be backed against a wall, it’s an option to try and skirt your
            opponent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
          <div id='10pgIsvykQikq' class='anchorTag'></div>
          <p> 3. Retreat may be done at a jogging speed, while Step Back is always at a walk.</p>

        <p><strong class='orangeHeader'>STRIKE THE WEAPON</strong> This has two purposes: to either knock an opponent's

      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>

      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pPUtVwXXzWQ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> A character whose Health is below 0 is bleeding out and is danger of dying. He falls unconscious and is
          unable to do anything.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10prWgRCAbpxQ' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Every 5 seconds that character is in this state, he rolls a Con check + his current Health vs d20! + 10. If
          he fails, he takes another point of damage. If he succeeds, he doesn’t lose any Health that second.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pSfkHLHeknG' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> If he beats the roll by more than 10, he stabilizes: he no longer has to roll for bleeding out but he is
          still knocked out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='marginBottom paragraphShell anchor'>
        <div id='10pnhJknsUjJh' class='anchorTag'></div>
        <p> Should his Health reach half his Con in the negative, he has died. So, a character with 12 Con dies at -6,
